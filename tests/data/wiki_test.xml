'''Anarchism''' is an [[Anti-authoritarianism|anti-authoritarian]] [[Political philosophy|political]] and [[Social philosophy|social philosophy]]{{sfn|Flint|2009|p=27}} that rejects [[Hierarchy|hierarchies]] as unjust and advocates their replacement with [[Workers' self-management|self-managed]], [[Self-governance|self-governed]] societies based on voluntary, [[cooperative]] institutions. These institutions are often described as [[Stateless society|stateless societies]],{{sfnm|1a1=Sheehan|1y=2003|1p=85|2a1=Craig|2y=2005|2p=14}} although several authors have defined them more specifically as distinct institutions based on non-hierarchical or [[Free association (communism and anarchism)|free associations]].{{sfn|Suissa|2006|p=7}} Anarchism's central disagreement with other ideologies is that it holds the [[Sovereign state|state]] to be undesirable, unnecessary, and harmful.{{sfnm|1a1=McLean|1a2=McMillan|1y=2003|loc=Anarchism|2a1=Craig|2y=2005|2p=14}}

Anarchism is usually placed on the [[Far-left politics|far-left]] of the [[political spectrum]],{{sfnm|1a1=Brooks|1y=1994|1p=xi|2a1=Kahn|2y=2000|3a1=Moynihan|3y=2007}} and much of its [[Anarchist economics|economics]] and [[Anarchist law|legal philosophy]] reflect [[Libertarian socialism|anti-authoritarian interpretations]] of [[Anarcho-communism|communism]], [[Collectivist anarchism|collectivism]], [[Anarcho-syndicalism|syndicalism]], [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]], or [[participatory economics]].{{sfn|Guerin|1970|p=35|loc=Critique of authoritarian socialism}} As anarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular worldview,{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=14–17}} many [[History of anarchism|anarchist types and traditions]] exist and varieties of anarchy diverge widely.{{sfn|Sylvan|2007|p=262}} [[Anarchist schools of thought]] can differ fundamentally, supporting anything from extreme [[individualism]] to complete [[collectivism]].{{sfn|McLean|McMillan|2003|loc=Anarchism}} Strains of anarchism have often been divided into the categories of [[Social anarchism|social]] and [[individualist anarchism]], or similar dual classifications.{{sfnm|1a1=Fowler|1y=1972|2a1=Kropotkin|2y=2002|2p=5|3a1=Ostergaard|3y=2009|3p=14|3loc=Anarchism}}

== Etymology, terminology, and definition ==
{{main|Definition of anarchism}}
{{see also|Anarchist terminology}}
The etymological origin of the word anarchism is from the ancient Greek word ''anarkhia'',  meaning &quot;without a ruler&quot;, composed of the prefix ''a-'' (i.e. &quot;without&quot;) and the word ''arkhos'' (i.e. &quot;leader&quot; or &quot;ruler&quot;). The suffix [[-ism]] denotes the ideological current that favours anarchy.{{sfnm|1a1=Bates|1y=2017|1p=128|2a1=Long|2y=2013|2p=217}} The word anarchism appears in English from 1642{{sfn|Definition of Anarchism by Merriam-Webster|2019}} as ''anarchisme''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OED|anarchism}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the word ''anarchy'' from 1539.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OED|anarchy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various factions within the [[French Revolution]] labelled their opponents as anarchists, although few such accused shared many views with later anarchists. Many revolutionaries of the 19th century such as [[William Godwin]] (1756–1836) and [[Wilhelm Weitling]] (1808–1871) would contribute to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation, but they did not use the word anarchist or anarchism in describing themselves or their beliefs.{{sfn|Joll|1964|pp=27–37}}
