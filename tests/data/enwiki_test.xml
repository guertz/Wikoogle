&lt;!-- There's not much discussion going on the talk page, so I've condensed the lead down by a massive amount. Hopefully this will suffice. If not, I've left the Lead Too Long tag here, just commented out: {{Lead too long|date=June 2018}} --&gt;
'''Dream Theater''' is an American [[progressive metal]] band formed in 1985 under the name '''Majesty''' by [[John Petrucci]], [[John Myung]] and [[Mike Portnoy]] while they attended [[Berklee College of Music]] in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]. They subsequently dropped out of their studies to concentrate further on the band that would eventually become Dream Theater. Though a number of lineup changes followed, the three original members remained together until September 8, 2010, when Portnoy left the band. [[Mike Mangini]] was announced as the new permanent drummer on April 29, 2011. In 1991, [[James LaBrie]] joined replacing [[Charlie Dominici]] as the lead singer of the band and has been the singer ever since. The band's first keyboardist, [[Kevin Moore]], left the band after three albums and was replaced by [[Derek Sherinian]] in 1995 after a period of touring. After one album with Sherinian, the band replaced him with current keyboardist [[Jordan Rudess]] in 1999.

To date, Dream Theater has released fourteen studio albums. The band's highest-selling release is their second album ''[[Images and Words]]'' (1992), which reached No.&amp;nbsp;61 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart.&lt;ref name=&quot;charts&quot;&gt;Billboard Chart history for Dream Theater can be seen at [{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=dream theater|chart=all}} Billboard.com].&lt;/ref&gt; Both the albums ''[[Awake (Dream Theater album)|Awake]]'' (1994) and ''[[Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence]]'' (2002) also entered the charts at No.&amp;nbsp;32 and No.&amp;nbsp;46, respectively, and received critical acclaim. ''[[Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory]]'' was ranked number 95 on the October 2006 issue of ''[[Guitar World]]'' magazine's list of ''The greatest 100 guitar albums of all time''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guitar World's (Readers Choice) Greatest 100 Guitar Albums Of All Time|url=http://www.chud.com/community/t/91743/guitar-worlds-readers-choice-greatest-100-guitar-albums-of-all-time|publisher=chud.com|accessdate=July 7, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120805161515/http://www.chud.com/community/t/91743/guitar-worlds-readers-choice-greatest-100-guitar-albums-of-all-time|archive-date=August 5, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is ranked as the 15th Greatest Concept Album as of March 2003 by ''[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock Magazine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Classic Rock Magazine - Rock's 30 Greatest Concept Albums (March 2003)|url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/steveparker/classicrock.htm|publisher=rocklistmusic.co.uk|accessdate=May 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Formation (1985–1987)===
Dream Theater was formed in Massachusetts in 1985 when guitarist John Petrucci, bassist John Myung, and drummer Mike Portnoy decided to form a band while attending the Berklee College of Music. The trio started by covering [[Rush (band)|Rush]] and [[Iron Maiden]] songs in the rehearsal rooms at Berklee.

Myung, Petrucci, and Portnoy joined together on the name Majesty for their newly formed group. According to ''[[Score (Dream Theater album)|The Score So Far...]]'' documentary, they were waiting in line for tickets to a Rush concert at the Berklee Performance Center while listening to the band on a boom box. Portnoy commented that the ending of the song &quot;[[Bastille Day (song)|Bastille Day]]&quot; (from the album ''[[Caress of Steel]]'') sounded &quot;majestic&quot;. It was then decided that Majesty would be the band's name.&lt;ref name=&quot;score so far&quot;&gt;This was referenced in the documentary &quot;The Score so Far&quot;, on the second disc of the ''[[Score (Dream Theater album)|Score]]'' DVD.&lt;/ref&gt;

The trio then set out to fill the remaining positions in the group. Petrucci asked his high school bandmate [[Kevin Moore]] to play the keyboard. After he accepted the position, another friend from home, [[Chris Collins (singer)|Chris Collins]], was recruited as lead vocalist after band members heard him sing a cover of &quot;Queen of the Reich&quot; by [[Queensrÿche]].&lt;ref&gt;Portnoy, Mike (2003). &quot;The Majesty Demos 1985-1986&quot; [CD Liner Notes]. New York: Ytsejam Records.&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Portnoy, Petrucci, and Myung's hectic schedules forced them to abandon their studies to concentrate on their music, as they did not feel they could learn more in college. Moore also left his college, [[State University of New York at Fredonia|SUNY Fredonia]], to concentrate on the band.

{{listen|filename=Dream_Theater_-_Another_Won.ogg|title=&quot;Another Won&quot;|description=&quot;Another Won&quot; from ''[[The Majesty Demos]]''}}
The beginning months of 1986 were filled with various concert dates in and around the New York City area. During this time, the band recorded a collection of demos, titled ''[[The Majesty Demos]]''. The initial run of 1,000 sold out within six months, and dubbed copies of the cassette became popular within the progressive metal scene. The ''Majesty Demos'' are still available in their original tape format today, despite being released officially on CD, through Mike Portnoy's YtseJam Records.

In November 1986, after a few months of writing and performing together, Chris Collins was fired.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} After a year of trying to find a replacement, [[Charlie Dominici]], who was far older and more experienced than anyone else in the band, successfully auditioned for the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prog-sphere.com/interviews/charlie-dominici |title=Charlie Dominici - A Trilogy Concluded, a Career to be Continued |last=Savić |first=Nikola |date=June 16, 2010 |website=Prog-sphere.com |access-date=August 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the stability that Dominici's appointment brought to Majesty, they began to increase the number of shows played in the New York City area, gaining a considerable amount of exposure.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Shortly after hiring Dominici, a Las Vegas group also named Majesty&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gabbo.net/dt/faq/ |title=The Dream Theater FAQ – Graphic Version |publisher=Gabbo.net |date= |accessdate=January 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; threatened legal action for [[intellectual property infringement]] related to the use of their name, so the band was forced to adopt a new moniker. Various possibilities were proposed and tested, among them Glasser, Magus, and M1, which were all rejected, though the band did go as Glasser for about a week, with poor reactions from fans. Eventually, Portnoy's father suggested the name Dream Theater, the name of a small theater in [[Monterey, California]], and the name stuck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLRo9RT539k |title=Mike Portnoy – Wikipedia: Fact or Fiction? |publisher=YouTube |date=April 1, 2015 |accessdate=January 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''When Dream and Day Unite'' (1988–1990)===
With their new name and band stability, Dream Theater concentrated on writing more material while playing more concerts in New York and in neighboring states. This eventually attracted the attention of Mechanic Records, a division of [[MCA Inc.|MCA]]. Dream Theater signed their first record contract with Mechanic on June 23, 1988&lt;ref name=&quot;WDADU Demos&quot;&gt;Portnoy, Mike (2004). And Nathan Edmonds help produce &quot;When Dream and Day Unite Demos&quot; 1987-1989 [CD Liner Notes]. New York: YtseJam Records.&lt;/ref&gt; and set out to record their debut album. The band recorded the album at Kajem Victory Studios in [[Gladwyne, Pennsylvania]]. Recording the basic tracks took about 10 days, and the entire album was completed in about 3 weeks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Charlie Dominici&quot;&gt;Dominici, Charlie. When Dream And Day Unite liner notes (2004 re-release).&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[When Dream and Day Unite]]'' was released in 1989 to far less fanfare than the band had anticipated. Mechanic ended up breaking the majority of the financial promises they had made to Dream Theater prior to signing their contract, so the band was restricted to playing around New York City. The promotional tour for the album consisted of just five concerts, all of which were relatively local. Their first show was at Sundance in [[Bay Shore, New York]] opening for the classic rock power trio [[Zebra (American band)|Zebra]].&lt;ref name=&quot;tourography&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mikeportnoy.com/dates/tourography/?tour=4 |title=Mike Portnoy.com The Official Website |website=Mikeportnoy.com |date= |accessdate=January 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the fourth show, Charlie Dominici was let go because the band was starting to feel the limitations of his voice based upon the vocal style they wanted. The band was looking for a singer with a style more like [[Bruce Dickinson]] or [[Geoff Tate]], and Dominici's stage presence was not what they wanted for a front man. Shortly after, however, the band [[Marillion]] asked Dream Theater to open for them at a gig at the Ritz in New York, so Dominici was given the opportunity to perform one last time.&lt;ref name=&quot;tourography&quot;/&gt; It would be another two years before Dream Theater had a replacement vocalist.

=== Addition of James LaBrie and ''Images and Words'' (1991–1993) ===

[[File:James LaBrie 2.jpg|thumb|left|190px|James LaBrie joined the band in January 1991 and has been their vocalist ever since.]]
Following Dominici's departure, Dream Theater fought successfully to be released from their contract with Mechanic, and set about auditioning singers and writing material for their next album. In their search for a new singer, they auditioned over 200 people, among them former [[Fates Warning]] front man [[John Arch]]. John ultimately decided that his personal commitments were more important and he opted not to join the band.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fateswarning.com/Media/Interviews/1995/19950101.aspx |title=John Arch Interview by Jeff Wagner (1995) |publisher=Fateswarning.com |date= |accessdate=February 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 9, 1990, at a gig at Sundance in Bay Shore, New York, Dream Theater introduced Steve Stone as their new singer after playing half the set as an instrumental band. Stone had successfully recorded demos with Dream Theater, but he was fired following a single, ill-fated live performance. According to Mike Portnoy, Stone moved around the stage in a rather odd manner, seemingly doing a bad impression of [[Bruce Dickinson]]. Additionally, he shouted &quot;Scream for me Long Beach!&quot; several times throughout the show (Dickinson can be heard saying this on Iron Maiden's live album ''[[Live After Death]]''), although they were actually performing in Bay Shore.&lt;ref name=&quot;steve stone&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mikeportnoy.com/dates/MPTourography/ShowInfo.aspx?showId=29 |title=Mike Portnoy.com The Official Website |website=Mikeportnoy.com |date= |accessdate=January 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The audience was immediately turned off by the new singer.  It was five months before Dream Theater played another show, this time all-instrumental (under the name YtseJam). Until 1991, the band remained focused in an attempt to hire another singer and writing additional music.&lt;ref name=&quot;tourography&quot; /&gt; It was during this period that they wrote the majority of what would become ''Images and Words'' (1992).

In January 1991, the band received a demo tape from [[James LaBrie|Kevin James LaBrie]], of [[glam metal]] band [[Winter Rose (band)|Winter Rose]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Larkin2011&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Colin Larkin|title=The Encyclopedia of Popular Music|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_NNmFiUnSmUC&amp;pg=PA2006-IA1908|date=May 27, 2011|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=978-0-85712-595-8|pages=2006–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band had received the tape just before they were about to commit to another singer. The band was so impressed by his demo that he was flown from Canada to New York for an audition. LaBrie jammed on three songs with the band, and was immediately hired to fill the vocalist position. Once recruited, LaBrie decided to drop his first name to avoid confusion with the other Kevin in the band. For the next few months, the band returned to playing live shows (still mostly around NYC), while working on vocal parts for the music written before acquiring LaBrie. [[Derek Shulman]] and [[Atco Records]] (now [[East West Records|East West]]), a division of [[Elektra Records]], signed Dream Theater to a seven-album contract based on a three-song demo (later made available as &quot;The Atco Demos&quot; through the Dream Theater [[fan club]]).

The first album to be recorded under their new record contract was ''[[Images and Words]]'' (1992). For promotion, the label released a CD Single and [[music video|video clip]] for the song &quot;[[Another Day (Dream Theater song)|Another Day]]&quot;, but neither made significant commercial impact. The song &quot;[[Pull Me Under]]&quot;, however, managed to garner a high level of radio airplay without any organized promotion from the band or their label. In response, ATCO produced a video clip for &quot;Pull Me Under&quot;, which saw heavy rotation on [[MTV]]. A third video clip was produced for &quot;[[Take the Time]]&quot;, but it was not nearly as successful as &quot;Pull Me Under&quot;.

The success of &quot;Pull Me Under&quot;, combined with relentless touring throughout the U.S. and [[Japan]], caused ''Images and Words'' to achieve gold record certification in the States and platinum status in Japan. A tour of [[Europe]] followed in 1993, which included a show at [[London]]'s famed [[Marquee Club]]. The show was recorded and released as ''[[Live at the Marquee (Dream Theater album)|Live at the Marquee]]'', Dream Theater's first official live album. Additionally, a video compilation of their Japanese concerts (mixed in with documentary-style footage of the off-stage portion of the tour) was released as ''[[Images and Words: Live in Tokyo]]''.

===''Awake'' and Kevin Moore's departure (1994–1995)===
{| style=&quot;float:right;&quot;
|-
|{{listen|filename=A Mind Beside Itself - II - Voices (Dream Theater song - sample).ogg|title=&quot;A Mind Beside Itself: II – Voices&quot;|description=&quot;Voices&quot; from ''[[Awake (Dream Theater album)|Awake]]''.}}

Eager to work on fresh material, Dream Theater retreated to the studio in May 1994. ''[[Awake (Dream Theater album)|Awake]]'', Dream Theater's third studio album, was released on October 4, 1994 amidst a storm of fan controversy. Shortly before the album was mixed, Moore had announced to the rest of the band that he would be quitting Dream Theater to concentrate on his own musical interests, since he was no longer interested in touring or the style of music which Dream Theater performed.&lt;ref&gt;EastWest Records Press Release.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the band had to scramble to find a replacement keyboardist before a tour could be considered.

Former [[Yngwie Malmsteen]]/[[Dio (band)|Dio]] keyboardist [[Jens Johansson]], who would go on to become a member of [[Stratovarius]], was among the biggest names to audition, but the band members were eager to fill the position with keyboardist [[Jordan Rudess]]. Portnoy and Petrucci had come across Rudess in Keyboard Magazine, where he was recognized as &quot;best new talent&quot; in the readers' poll. The two invited him to play a trial gig with the band at the [[Concrete Marketing|Concrete]] [[Foundations Forum]] in [[Burbank, California]].&lt;ref name=&quot;tourography&quot; /&gt; Although the show was a success, and Rudess was asked to fill the keyboardist position permanently, he opted to tour with The [[Dixie Dregs]] instead, since it granted him more personal latitude. Dream Theater hired fellow Berklee alumnus [[Derek Sherinian]], who had previously toured and recorded with [[Alice Cooper]] and [[Kiss (band)|KISS]], to fill in for the ''[[Waking Up the World Tour]]''. By the conclusion of the tour, the band decided to take Sherinian on as Moore's full-time replacement.&lt;ref name=&quot;score so far&quot; /&gt;

===''A Change of Seasons'', ''Falling into Infinity'' (1995–1998)===
{| style=&quot;float:right;&quot;
|-
|{{listen|filename=Dream_Theater_-_ACOS.ogg|title=&quot;A Change of Seasons&quot;|description=&quot;Carpe Diem/The Darkest of Winters&quot; bridge from ''[[A Change of Seasons]]''.}}
|}

Once again finding themselves with a new member, the band did not immediately start working on new material. Fans around the world, united on the YtseJam [[Electronic mailing list|Mailing List]] (the most popular form of communication between Dream Theater fans at that point), had begun to put pressure on the band to officially release the song &quot;[[A Change of Seasons (song)|A Change of Seasons]]&quot;. This had been written in 1989 and was intended to be a part of ''Images and Words'', but at almost 17 minutes, it was deemed too long for studio placement. It had nevertheless been performed live by the band, who continued to revise it in the years leading up to 1995.

The petition was successful, and the group entered [[BearTracks Studios]] in New York in May 1995 to rewrite and record the now 23-minute-long song with Sherinian contributing significantly to the final product. The band released &quot;A Change of Seasons&quot; as an [[Extended play|EP]] along with a collection of cover songs from a live show recorded at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club in London earlier that year.

After a brief run of small concerts and a short break, the band released a special Christmas CD through their official fan club, consisting of rare live tracks recorded during the band's early years. They continued releasing a new CD each Christmas until 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Nine Christmas CDs were released through Dream Theater's fan club before it was closed down in 2005. See [http://www.dreamtheater.net/dtifc.php?p=annualcd DTIFC on Dream Theater.net]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090102141152/http://www.dreamtheater.net/dtifc.php?p=annualcd |date=January 2, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, there were several changes at East West, and Dream Theater's main contact within the label was fired. As a result, the new team at the company were unaccustomed to the relationship Dream Theater had with former East West personnel, and they pressured them to write an album that was more accessible. In mid-1997, they entered the studio to write their next album. In addition to pressuring the band to adopt a more mainstream sound, East West recruited writer/producer [[Desmond Child]] to work with Petrucci on polishing the lyrics to his song &quot;You or Me&quot;. The whole band substantially reworked the song, and it appeared on the album as &quot;You Not Me&quot; with a chorus that bore little resemblance to the original. Child also had a noticeable impact on the album, with a shift towards less complex and more radio-friendly compositions.

The band wrote almost two [[Compact Disc|CD]]s worth of material, including a 20-minute-long follow-up to the ''Images and Words'' song &quot;Metropolis–Part I: The Miracle and the Sleeper&quot;. The label, however, did not allow the release of a double album because it felt that a 140-minute record would not be well received by the general public. James LaBrie also felt that the CD should be a single disc.&lt;ref&gt;LaBrie, James. (Summer '97) ''Images &amp; Words No.&amp;nbsp;14'',  pg. 5
&lt;/ref&gt; The unused songs were later released in the Ytsejam Records release ''The Falling into Infinity Demos''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ytsejamrecords.com/ProductCart/pc/viewPrd.asp?idcategory=6&amp;idproduct=26 |title=Falling into Infinity Demos |publisher=Ytsejamrecords.com |date= |accessdate=July 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The material that made it onto the album proper was released as ''[[Falling into Infinity]]'', which received a mixed reception from fans who were more familiar with the band's earlier sound. While the album was moderately progressive-sounding, tracks such as &quot;[[Hollow Years]]&quot; and &quot;You Not Me&quot; prompted some to believe it was the dawn of a new, mainstream-sounding Dream Theater. Overall, the album was both a critical and commercial disappointment. Although Portnoy did not speak out publicly at the time, he later revealed in the 2004 DVD commentary for ''[[5 Years in a Livetime]]'', that he had been so discouraged during this period that he had considered disbanding Dream Theater altogether.

During the European leg of the Touring Into Infinity world tour, two shows were recorded for a live album entitled ''[[Once in a LIVEtime]]'', in [[France]] and The [[Netherlands]]. The album was released at around the same time as the video ''[[5 Years in a Livetime]]'', which covered the years from Kevin Moore's departure to the ''Falling into Infinity'' promotional tour.

===Derek Sherinian's departure, addition of Jordan Rudess, and ''Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory'' (1999–2000)===
In 1997, [[Magna Carta Records]]' Mike Varney invited Portnoy to assemble a progressive '[[supergroup (bands)|supergroup]]' to work on an album, which would become the first in a long string of side-projects for the members of Dream Theater.&lt;ref&gt;Portnoy, Mike (1998). &quot;Liquid Tension Experiment&quot; [CD Liner Notes]. New York: Magna Carta Records.&lt;/ref&gt;  The lineup consisted of Portnoy on drums, Petrucci on guitar, [[Tony Levin]] on bass, and keyboardist Jordan Rudess, who had finished with the Dixie Dregs. The band assumed the name [[Liquid Tension Experiment]], and would act as a medium through which Portnoy and Petrucci could once again court Rudess to join Dream Theater. In 1999, he accepted an offer to become the third full-time Dream Theater keyboardist, replacing Sherinian.&lt;ref name=&quot;score so far&quot; /&gt;

With yet another new member, Dream Theater entered BearTracks Studio once again to write and record their next album. As a result of an ultimatum from Portnoy, the label gave the band complete creative control. The band began by revisiting the follow-up to &quot;Metropolis–Part I&quot;, which had been partially written during the ''Falling into Infinity'' sessions but which had not been completed or used on that album. They decided to expand the 21-minute song into a complete [[concept album]], with a story revolving around themes such as reincarnation, murder and betrayal. To avoid stirring up the fan base, a tight veil of secrecy enveloped the writing and recording process. The only things fans were privy to prior to its release were a track list that had been leaked against the band's wishes, and a release date. In 1999, ''[[Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory]]'' was released to high critical acclaim, being lauded as the band's masterpiece, despite only reaching No.&amp;nbsp;73 on the US album chart.&lt;ref name=&quot;charts&quot; /&gt;

The album was mixed by [[David Bottrill]], but only a few of his mixes made it on the final album. The bulk was remixed by [[Kevin Shirley]], who had produced ''Falling into Infinity''. The rest of the mixes can be heard in the band's official bootleg ''The Making of Scenes from a Memory''.

The subsequent [[Metropolis 2000 (Dream Theater Tour)|Metropolis 2000]] world tour was by far their largest to date, and took over a year to complete. The concerts reflected the theatrical aspect of the album, with the first half of each show comprising the entire ''Scenes From a Memory'' album accompanied by a film showing dramatized portions of the story projected onto a video screen behind the stage. For the last date of the North American leg, at the [[Roseland Ballroom]] in New York City, actors were hired to play characters in the story, and a gospel choir was enlisted to perform in some sections of the performance. The show was filmed and eventually released in early 2001 as the band's first DVD release, ''[[Metropolis 2000: Scenes from New York]]'', which was certified Gold in the US on November 8, 2002.&lt;ref name=&quot;riaa.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?content_selector=gold-platinum-searchable-database |title=Gold &amp; Platinum Searchable Database - August 09, 2014 |publisher=RIAA |date= |accessdate=August 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since several songs from the second half of the four-hour show had to be cut from the DVD to save space, the band also released the full show on the live CD ''[[Live Scenes from New York]]''. The original cover depicted one of Dream Theater's early logos (the ''Images and Words''-era burning heart, modeled on the [[Sacred Heart]] of Christ) modified to show an apple (as in &quot;[[Big Apple]]&quot;) instead of the heart, and the New York skyline, including the twin towers of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]], in the flame above it. In an unfortunate coincidence, the album was released on the same date as the [[September 11 attacks]]. The album was quickly recalled by the band and was re-released with revised artwork later,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mikeportnoy.com/aboutmike/faq/answers/12.aspx#213 | title=Mike Portnoy FAQ }}&lt;/ref&gt; although the few copies which were sold with the original artwork have since become rare collector's items.

===''Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence'' (2001–2002)===

|}

Putting the whole ordeal behind them, Dream Theater once again entered BearTracks Studios to record their sixth studio album. Four years after they first petitioned East West to allow them to release a double album, they finally got their chance with ''[[Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence]]''. The first disc consisted of five tracks of 7–13 minutes in length, and the second disc was devoted entirely to the 42-minute title track, which remains to date the longest song Dream Theater has written. Many of the song's melodies and musical themes originated in an instrumental piece, written by Rudess, which would eventually become the song's &quot;Overture&quot;. Those themes were then expanded by the rest of the band to form individual chapters in a complete story.&lt;ref name=&quot;score so far&quot;/&gt;

''Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence'' was very well received by critics and the press. It was the most publicized of Dream Theater's albums since ''Awake'', debuting on the Billboard charts at No.&amp;nbsp;46&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web| url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=dream theater|chart=all}}| title=Billboard Chart history for Dream Theater }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Billboard Internet charts at No.&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dreamtheater.net/archive_dreamtheater.php?y=2002#billboard DreamTheater.net] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725011754/http://www.dreamtheater.net/archive_dreamtheater.php?y=2002#billboard |date=July 25, 2011 }} reported that ''Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence'' had reached No.&amp;nbsp;1 on the Billboard Internet Charts.&lt;/ref&gt; The subsequent world tour included a select few special &quot;album cover&quot; gigs (see [[#Cover songs|Cover songs]] section, below), in which they played Metallica's ''[[Master of Puppets]]'' and Iron Maiden's ''[[The Number of the Beast (album)|The Number of the Beast]]'' in their entirety.

===''Train of Thought'' (2003–2004)===
In 2003, Dream Theater entered the studio to write and record another album. Unlike ''Scenes from a Memory'', which had been written and recorded simultaneously in the studio, the band took a different approach by setting aside three weeks for writing prior to recording. In the middle of the recording sessions for the album, a special tour with two other progressive metal bands, Queensrÿche and Fates Warning, was undertaken in North America. Referred to in the band's promotional material as the &quot;Escape from the Studio American tour&quot;, the tour featured Queensrÿche and Dream Theater as co-headlining acts with Fates Warning performing supporting act duties. As a finale for each concert there was an extended encore in which both Dream Theater and Queensrÿche performed together on stage simultaneously, often playing cover songs.

At the completion of the tour, Dream Theater returned to the studio to finish the recording of their seventh album, ''[[Train of Thought (Dream Theater album)|Train of Thought]]''. In contrast to the extended songs of their previous album, the band aimed to write a more song-oriented album, inspired in part by covering the ''Master of Puppets'' and ''Number of the Beast'' albums on their previous concert tour.&lt;ref&gt;Mike Portnoy (2007) &quot;In Constant Motion&quot; Instructional [[DVD]], ''Train of Thought'' album analysis.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the album was a critical success, its more straightforward metal sound alienated many of the band's existing fans, who had been attracted by the band's roots in [[progressive rock]].&lt;ref name=&quot;score so far&quot; /&gt; During this time they also re-released their first two live videos for the first time on DVD, entitled &quot;Images and Words: Live in Tokyo/5 Years in a Livetime&quot; on June 29, 2004, through Rhino Records. This release was certified Platinum on March 22, 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;riaa.com&quot;/&gt;

Another world tour followed, named [[Train of Thought Tour]]. A modest North American tour was completed by the two bands, which Dream Theater supported Yes, a band which had been a major influence on their own musical style. After which Dream Theater continued to tour the world with their so-called &quot;An Evening With Dream Theater&quot; shows. The latter were captured in another live CD/DVD release, recorded at the famous [[Nippon Budokan Hall]] in [[Tokyo]], Japan on their [[Train of Thought Tour]]. ''[[Live at Budokan (Dream Theater)|Live at Budokan]]'' was released on October 5, 2004, and was certified Platinum in the US on January 26, 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;riaa.com&quot;/&gt;

===''Octavarium'' (2005–2006)===
[[File:Dream theater live in Parigi 2005.jpg|250px|thumb|Dream Theater after a concert in Paris during the first European leg of their tour (2005). From left to right: [[Mike Portnoy]], [[John Petrucci]], [[James LaBrie]], [[John Myung]] and [[Jordan Rudess]]|alt=The five members of Dream Theater standing together in front of a drum kit and some amplifiers on a stage.]]
After their ''Train of Thought'' promotional tour, Dream Theater entered [[the Hit Factory]] studios in NYC to record their eighth album. They would in fact become the final group to use the famous studio, which closed on April 1, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digitalprosound.digitalmedianet.com/articles/viewarticle.jsp?id=45690|last=Moldstad|first=Frank|publisher=Digital Pro Sound|title=New York's Hit Factory Gets a New Identity|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220093309/http://digitalprosound.digitalmedianet.com/articles/viewarticle.jsp?id=45690|archive-date=December 20, 2016|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Octavarium (album)|Octavarium]]'' was released on June 7, 2005, and took the band's sound in yet another new direction. Its eight songs included a continuation of Portnoy's &quot;[[AA Suite|Twelve-step]]&quot; saga (&quot;The Root of All Evil&quot;, steps 6–7 in the 12-step plan), as well as the title track, a musically versatile 24 minute epic rivaling &quot;A Change of Seasons&quot;. ''Octavarium'' received mixed reviews from fans and has been the subject of spirited debate. ''Octavarium'' was the last album under their seven-album deal with [[Elektra Records]], which had inherited the contract upon its absorption of [[EastWest Records]].

Dream Theater started the [[Octavarium Tour]] extensively throughout 2005 and 2006 to celebrate their 20th Anniversary as a band, including a headlining spot on [[Gigantour]] alongside [[Megadeth]] and put together by frontman [[Dave Mustaine]], also featuring [[Fear Factory]], [[Nevermore]] and [[Symphony X]]. During a show on August 2, 2005 in Dallas, the band paid tribute to [[Pantera]]'s late guitarist [[Dimebag Darrell]] by performing the song &quot;[[Cemetery Gates]]&quot; as an encore. In addition was the unexpected appearance of fellow musicians [[Russell Allen]] (Symphony X vocalist), [[Burton C. Bell]] (Fear Factory vocalist) and [[Dave Mustaine]] (Megadeth vocalist/guitarist), who joined the band on stage to perform parts of the song.

Dream Theater later departed from Gigantour 2005 a few dates before it ended and continued on with their own series of concerts, several of which were recorded and released for the band's fanclubs. The 20th anniversary tour concluded with a show at [[Radio City Music Hall]] in New York City on April 1, 2006. Though the show had minimal promotion, it was sold out days after tickets were made available. This show, which was recorded for a CD/DVD called ''[[Score (Dream Theater album)|Score]]'' released on August 29, 2006 through [[Rhino Records]], featured songs from the band's entire history, as well a second half accompanied by a full symphony orchestra (the &quot;Octavarium Orchestra&quot;). This release was the band's third Live DVD release to be certified Platinum in the US on October 11, 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;riaa.com&quot;/&gt;

===''Systematic Chaos'' and ''Greatest Hit'' (2006–2008)===
[[File:Dream Theater 2326994259 c689a5f104 o.jpg|thumb|Dream Theater playing live March 8, 2008]]
For the first time in their career, the band decided to take the summer off after their show at Radio City Music Hall. In September 2006, Dream Theater entered Avatar Studios to record their follow-up to ''[[Octavarium]]'' with legendary studio engineer [[Paul Northfield]]. Dream Theater's ninth studio album, ''[[Systematic Chaos]]'', was released on June 5, 2007. The record marked their first with new label [[Roadrunner Records]], which in 2010 would become a wholly owned subsidiary of the band's previous label [[Atlantic Records]]. Roadrunner implemented increased promotion for the album and ''Systematic Chaos'' duly reached number 19 on the ''Billboard'' 200. It also oversaw the release of a video for &quot;[[Constant Motion]]&quot; on July 14, the band's first music video since Hollow Years in 1997. The album was bookended by the two parts of &quot;In the Presence of Enemies&quot;, written and conceived as a single piece but split into two halves for the purposes of the album. The other six tracks included the most recent part of Portnoy's continuing [[AA Saga]] with the song &quot;[[Repentance (song)|Repentance]]&quot;.

In the same year, the first version of Rich Wilson's ''[[Lifting Shadows]]'', an authorized history of the band's first twenty years, was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dreamtheaterbook.com/ |title=Lifting Shadows – The Authorised Story Of Dream Theater |publisher=Dreamtheaterbook.com |date= |accessdate=January 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2007–08 [[Chaos in Motion Tour]] started off in Italy. Dream Theater played in the [[Gods of Metal]] concert on June 3, 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.godsofmetal.it/ |title=Gods of Metal official website |publisher=Godsofmetal.it |accessdate=July 18, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719202238/http://www.godsofmetal.it/ |archivedate=July 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as various other European festivals including the Netherlands' Fields of Rock Festival, UK's [[Download Festival]], the French festival [[Hellfest Summer Open Air]] alongside [[Megadeth]], [[Korn]], [[Mastodon (band)|Mastodon]] and [[Slayer]]. The North American leg of the tour began on July 24 in [[San Diego]], [[California]] and wrapped up on August 26 in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]. They played with opening acts [[Redemption (band)|Redemption]] and [[Into Eternity (band)|Into Eternity]]. The Chaos In Motion Tour continued for the rest of the year and into 2008, playing shows in [[Asia]], [[South America]] and, for the first time, [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=81636 |title=Opeth To Support Dream Theater In North America – Blabbermouth.net |website=Roadrunnerrecords.com |date=September 27, 2007 |accessdate=January 30, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090410012728/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=81636 |archivedate=April 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 1, 2008, a two-disc [[compilation album]] entitled ''[[Greatest Hit (...and 21 Other Pretty Cool Songs)]]'' was released by the band. The title jokingly references the song &quot;[[Pull Me Under]]&quot;, the band's only significant [[Hit single|radio hit]]. It also includes three song re-mixes from their second album, ''Images and Words'', five edited versions of previously released songs, and a track from a single [[A-side and B-side|B-side]]. Unlike most [[greatest hits]] compilations, Dream Theater was actively involved with the album, coming up with the track listing that they felt best represented their musical careers.

After the release of ''Greatest Hit'', drummer Mike Portnoy organized a new tour called [[Progressive Nation 2008]]. Unlike previous Dream Theater tours, performances were held in cities that they had not visited before in the past (such as [[Vancouver|Vancouver, British Columbia]], Canada) or cities they had not played in for several years. This tour also marked the first time, since the release of Images and Words, where the group performed in small venues and performance halls.

In September 2008, the band released a DVD set called ''[[Chaos in Motion 2007–2008]]'', featuring songs recorded at several shows during the ''Chaos in Motion'' tour.

===''Black Clouds &amp; Silver Linings'' (2008–2010)===
On October 7, 2008, Dream Theater returned to Avatar Studios to begin work on their tenth album, resuming their relationship with [[Paul Northfield]] to engineer and mix the record. The album, entitled ''[[Black Clouds &amp; Silver Linings]]'', was released on June 23, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mikeportnoy.com/forum/m2268614.aspx |title=Dream Theater – Black Clouds &amp; Silver Linings |publisher=Mikeportnoy.com |date= |accessdate=July 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the standard CD, the album was made available on vinyl LP, as well as a 3-disc Special Edition CD that includes the full album, a CD of instrumental mixes of the album and a CD of six cover songs from artists such as [[Queen (band)|Queen]] and [[Rainbow (rock band)|Rainbow]]. On July 1, 2009, the album debuted at No.&amp;nbsp;6 on Billboard's Top 200 album chart, with first week sales totalling 40,285, making their highest entry on the chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegauntlet.com/article/1124/16276/Holy-Shit-Dream-Theater-debuts-at-6-on-Billboard-Top-200.html |title=Dream Theater debut's at 6 on Billboard Top 200, The Gauntlet |publisher=Thegauntlet.com |date= |accessdate=July 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album featured &quot;The Shattered Fortress&quot;, the last in Mike Portnoy's [[Twelve-step Suite|series of songs]] about his 12-step recovery from alcoholism, as well as the song &quot;The Best of Times&quot;, described by Portnoy as &quot;a real heavy personal subject about my dad who passed away during the making of the album ... He was battling cancer throughout its making.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/dream-theater%e2%80%99s-mike-portnoy-pens-tribute-to-late-father/ |title=Dream Theater’s Mike Portnoy Pens Tribute To Late Father |publisher=Metalhammer.co.uk |date=May 1, 2009 |accessdate=July 18, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629081851/http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/dream-theater%E2%80%99s-mike-portnoy-pens-tribute-to-late-father/ |archivedate=June 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The band also embarked on a second Progressive Nation tour, including the tour's first performances in Europe. [[Opeth]], [[Unexpect]] and [[Bigelf]] supported Dream Theater in Europe, while [[Zappa Plays Zappa]], [[Pain Of Salvation]], and [[Beardfish (band)|Beardfish]] were slated to perform on the North American leg. However, Pain of Salvation and Beardfish were unable to tour with Dream Theater and Zappa Plays Zappa because of financial troubles within their respective record labels. The two new bands that filled the vacated slots for the [[Progressive Nation 2009]] tour in North America were [[Bigelf]] and [[Scale the Summit]] with Bigelf performing on both European and North American legs.

After the Progressive Nation Tour, Dream Theater re-entered the studio to write and record a brand new instrumental track for inclusion on the ''[[God of War III]]'' soundtrack EP ''[[God of War: Blood &amp; Metal]]''. The track, entitled &quot;Raw Dog&quot; (''God (of) War'' reversed), marked the first time that the band has written and recorded an exclusive track for an outside project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mikeportnoy.com/forum/m2443312.aspx|last= Portnoy|first=Mike|title=MP's Forecast for 2010|publisher=mikeportnoy.com|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  &quot;Raw Dog&quot; includes the first ever commercially recorded [[harpejji]] track, performed by [[Jordan Rudess]], as well as Dream Theater's final recorded performance with [[Mike Portnoy]] on drums. In December 2009, during their ''[[Black Clouds &amp; Silver Linings]]'' tour whilst visiting Australia, Dream Theater appeared with one support act, Pain of Salvation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Mark|last=Bredius |url=http://www.dreamtheater.net/tourdates.php#dtnzaustralia |title=tour dates for Australia, December 1–12, 2009 |publisher=Dreamtheater.net |date=June 14, 2011 |accessdate=July 18, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716150258/http://www.dreamtheater.net/tourdates.php |archivedate=July 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2010, they toured South America with [[Bigelf]]. Afterwards, during the summer of 2010, Dream Theater supported [[Iron Maiden]] on the US and Canadian legs of their [[The Final Frontier World Tour|summer tour]] which were the last shows DT played during 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/news/Dream-Theater-To-Tour-With-Iron-Maiden-This-Summer-21029.aspx |title=Dream Theater to tour with Iron Maiden this summer 2010 |publisher=Road Runner Records |accessdate=July 18, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110312075747/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/news/Dream-Theater-To-Tour-With-Iron-Maiden-This-Summer-21029.aspx |archivedate=March 12, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mike Portnoy's departure (2010–2011)===
[[File:MIke Portnoy playing the drums (Rio de Janeiro, 2006).jpg|250px|thumb|Mike Portnoy announced that he would be leaving Dream Theater on September 8, 2010.]]
On September 8, 2010, [[Mike Portnoy]] announced that he would be leaving Dream Theater, citing better relationships in other projects, burnout, and his desire for a break as reasons.&lt;ref name=MP&gt;{{cite web|last=Portnoy|first=Mike|title=Mike Portnoy leaves Dream Theater|url=https://www.facebook.com/notes/mike-portnoy/mike-portnoy-leaves-dream-theater/137362372974878|publisher=Facebook|accessdate=July 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elaborating on the situation for [[MusicRadar]], [[John Petrucci]] revealed that originally, Portnoy did not want to leave the band; he only wanted to take a five-year break.&lt;ref name=MR&gt;{{cite web|last=Bosso|first=Joe|title=Interview: Dream Theater's John Petrucci, Jordan Rudess on the band's future|url=http://www.musicradar.com/news/guitars/interview-dream-theaters-john-petrucci-jordan-rudess-on-the-bands-future-442741|publisher=MusicRadar|accessdate=December 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He eventually dropped this number to around one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=145872 |title=Mike Portnoy: 'It Would Be A Tragedy If I Never Got To Be On Stage With Dream Theater Again' |accessdate=July 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only after the rest of the band rejected his proposal did Portnoy decide to quit.

After Portnoy left Dream Theater, relationships between him and his former bandmates became strained. In February 2011, Portnoy complained that no one from the band was returning his calls and e-mails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mike Portnoy: Dream Theater Members Are Refusing To Answer My E-Mails And Calls – Feb. 25, 2011|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=154516|work=Blabbermouth|accessdate=July 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, later Portnoy commented that both Petrucci and Rudess were the only members that stayed in touch with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tntradiorock.com/mike-portnoy-shattered-fortress-be-prog-my-friend-2017-entrevista-tnt/|title=Mike Portnoy - Shattered Fortress - Be Prog My Friend 2017|first=|last=TNT Radio Rock|date=April 23, 2017|website=TNTRadioRock.com|accessdate=January 9, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tensions became especially high when Portnoy called James LaBrie &quot;disrespectful&quot; for comments LaBrie made during an interview,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harris |first=Chris |title=Mike Portnoy Fires Back At James LaBrie |url=http://gunshyassassin.com/news/mike-portnoy-fires-back-at-james-labrie/ |publisher=Gun Shy Assassin |accessdate=July 8, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313154614/http://gunshyassassin.com/news/mike-portnoy-fires-back-at-james-labrie/ |archivedate=March 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; stating that Dream Theater were &quot;not sad at all&quot; that Portnoy was no longer a band member.

I’ve only needed a break, and I’ve had that break. So I’m ready, willing and able. But I honestly don’t think they ever will; they’ve closed their door on it and I think they’re too headstrong in having to prove themselves without me. So I wouldn’t count on it.

A little more than a month after Portnoy's departure, Dream Theater began auditioning for a new drummer in New York City. The drummers who auditioned were [[Mike Mangini]], [[Derek Roddy]], [[Thomas Lang]], [[Virgil Donati]], [[Marco Minnemann]], [[Aquiles Priester]], and [[Peter Wildoer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dream Theater: 'The Spirit Carries On' Drummer-Search Web Series To Be Released On DVD - Apr. 28, 2011|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=157437|work=Blabbermouth|accessdate=July 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fates Warning]] drummer [[Bobby Jarzombek]] was also invited to audition, but had to turn down the offer due to scheduling conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/bobby-jarzombek-why-i-turned-down-dream-theater-drummer-audition/|title=BOBBY JARZOMBEK: Why I Turned Down DREAM THEATER Drummer Audition|first=|last=Blabbermouth|date=November 16, 2013|website=Blabbermouth.net|accessdate=May 12, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The candidates were notified whether they had been chosen on November 5;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wildoer|first=Peter|title=Re: An Exclusive Look into The Band’s Search for a New Drummer|url=http://www.dreamtheaterforums.org/boards/index.php?topic=22228.msg865423#msg865423|publisher=Dream Theater Forums|accessdate=July 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the results of the audition were not made public until April 2011 via a three-part [[YouTube]] documentary series called ''The Spirit Carries On''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dream Theater – The Spirit Carries On Episode 3|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QHMQjH17aw |publisher=YouTube|accessdate=July 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the last episode of the series, it was revealed that Mangini was the drummer selected. Petrucci later explained that Portnoy approached them to rejoin after they had selected Mangini; Mangini by this time had left his job as a professor at Berklee and committed to Dream Theater full-time, so Portnoy's offer was rebuffed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/general_music_news/dream_theater_explain_why_mike_portnoy_cant_rejoin.html |title=Dream Theater Explain Why Mike Portnoy Can't Rejoin &amp;#124; Music News @ |publisher=Ultimate-guitar.com |date= |accessdate=August 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The album sold more than 34,000 copies in its first week and landed on the ''Billboard'' 200 chart at No. 7, the band's third consecutive top 10 album. In addition, the album cracked the top 10 in 24 countries including Japan, Germany, Argentina, The Netherlands, Finland, Italy, Switzerland, Canada, Denmark, Norway, Austria, Australia and United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/dream-theaters-new-album-cracks-u-s-top-10/ |title=Dream Theater's New Album Cracks U.S. Top 10 |website=Blabbermouth.net |date=October 2, 2013 |accessdate=January 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dream Theater's seventh live album, ''[[Live at Luna Park]]'', was released on November 5, 2013.

On January 6, 2014, John Petrucci said that Dream Theater were already &quot;planting seeds for album No. 13&quot;. He commented: &quot;There are some song ideas and little things like that -- nothing really official, but the seeds just start to get planted. One of the great things about this career is that you have the opportunity every time to go in and start again with a blank slate and think, 'What can we do differently? How can we make this better? Where can we go from here?' Every album has a story, and to constantly have a fresh opportunity to do it is really satisfying.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Gary|last=Graff |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/5862286/dream-theater-planting-seeds-for-album-no-13 |title=Dream Theater Planting Seeds for Album No. 13 |magazine=Billboard |date=January 6, 2014 |accessdate=January 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a concept album set in a [[dystopia]]n future society devoid of real music, centering on a conflict between a group of rebels and an oppressive empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dreamtheater.net/theastonishingtracks |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131232732/http://www.dreamtheater.net/theastonishingtracks |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 31, 2016 |title=Track Description |work=dreamtheater.net |accessdate=January 31, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two singles, &quot;The Gift of Music&quot; and &quot;Moment of Betrayal&quot; were released on December 3, 2015 and January 22, 2016, respectively.

Throughout 2016, Dream Theater went on a tour titled The Astonishing Live to support the album. They played the album in its entirety, with an intermission between the two acts, only playing songs from earlier albums on occasions later in the tour. Their performance was accompanied by a visual representation of the story on background screens. The band also made it a point to play at indoor theater halls such as [[Radio City Music Hall]]. In 2017, Dream Theater went on another tour, titled Images, Words &amp; Beyond, to commemorate the 25th anniversary of ''Images and Words''. Each night they performed the album in its entirety, as well as &quot;A Change of Seasons&quot;, which was originally written during the ''Images and Words'' sessions, and other selections from their catalogue.

In a May 2017 interview with ''Rockbook'', frontman [[James LaBrie]] talked about the style of the band's fourteenth studio album: &quot;It's really important for us that the new album will be our best effort. It should be who we are at that particular moment.

The game ultimately led to a site revealing the title of the album to be ''[[Distance over Time]]''.

===Upcoming fifteenth studio album (2020–present)===
In April 2020, Metal Addicts reported that Dream Theater is expected to begin working on their fifteenth studio album in 2021.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://metaladdicts.com/site/dream-theater-reschedule-australian-tour-to-november/|title=DREAM THEATER Reschedule Australian Tour To November|publisher=metaladdicts.com|date=April 25, 2020|accessdate=April 26, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Live performances==
Throughout their career, Dream Theater's live shows have gradually become bigger, longer and more diverse. Prior to Portnoy's departure, Dream Theater &quot;rotated&quot; its set lists to ensure that fans who attended multiple shows in the same area would not see too many (or any) songs repeated.  Portnoy, who constructed the set lists, would take into account the set list from the last time the band was in a particular city for the benefit of fans who saw the band on successive tours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earplugsrequired.com/bands/dreamtheater/dreamtheatermike.html |title=Earplugs Required |publisher=Earplugs Required |date= |accessdate=January 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dream Theater Live in Argentina 03-03-08.jpg|250px|thumb|Rudess and Petrucci dueling in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]] (2008).]]
The band's full world tours, since ''Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence'', have predominantly been &quot;Evening with...&quot; tours, in which the band performs for at least three hours with an intermission and no opening act. The show that was recorded for ''Live Scenes From New York'' was nearly four hours in length, and resulted in Portnoy almost being hospitalized after acquiring severe food poisoning from the food he ate before the show.&lt;ref&gt;See the ''Metropolis 2000: Scenes From New York'' DVD&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, Scott &amp; Portnoy, Mike. &quot;[http://mikeportnoy.com/aboutmike/faq/answers/12.aspx#74 What’s this I hear about Mike being really sick after the Roseland (DVD) show?

There is also a significant amount of humor, casualness, and improvisation attached to a Dream Theater concert. In the midst of &quot;A Change of Seasons&quot; it is quite common for themes such as those for [[Major League Baseball]] and ''[[The Simpsons]]'' to be quoted, and Rudess routinely modifies his solo section in the song and others, often playing the [[ragtime]] section of &quot;When the Water Breaks&quot; from ''[[Liquid Tension Experiment 2]]''. Several songs included on ''Once in a LIVETime'' include snippets of others' pieces, such as [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]]'s &quot;Free Bird&quot; and [[Rimsky-Korsakov]]'s &quot;Flight of the Bumblebee.&quot; Other quotations include &quot;Mary Had a Little Lamb&quot; during &quot;Endless Sacrifice&quot; on the Gigantour, a calliope-inspired break between verses of &quot;Under a Glass Moon&quot;, a quote of &quot;[[Don't Cry for Me, Argentina]]&quot;'s main melody played by Petrucci while performing the intro solo of &quot;Through Her Eyes&quot; in [[Buenos Aires]], the Turkish March at a concert in [[Istanbul]], and the opening riff of [[Rush (band)|Rush]]'s &quot;[[A Passage to Bangkok]]&quot; at a show in [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]]. On the &quot;20th Anniversary World Tour&quot; Rudess has even thrown in a short &quot;Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star&quot; theme in a break during &quot;Endless Sacrifice,&quot; and during a concert in Israel he started a spontaneous &quot;[[Hava Nagila]]&quot; later accompanied by the rest of the band. In Mumbai during the 25th Anniversary tour celebrating the album, Images of Words, the band closed the tune 'As I Am' off the album ' Train of Thought' with [[Metallica|Metallica's]] song [[Enter Sandman]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rollingstoneindia.com/concert-review-dream-theater-epic-near-jinxed-india-debut/|title=Concert Review: Dream Theater's Epic, Near-Jinxed India Debut -|date=October 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the best example of Dream Theater's unpredictable concert structure came during Derek Sherinian's time with the band. At selected shows the band members all [[Instrument-switch|swapped instruments]] and performed an encore as the fictitious band dubbed [[Nightmare Cinema (parody rock band)|Nightmare Cinema]]. They usually performed a cover of [[Deep Purple]]'s &quot;Perfect Strangers,&quot; and, on one occasion, [[Ozzy Osbourne]]'s &quot;Suicide Solution,&quot; At some shows, Sherinian, Petrucci and Portnoy would take the stage together under the name &quot;Nicky Lemons and the Migraine Brothers.&quot; Sherinian, wearing a feather boa and novelty sunglasses, would perform a pop-punk song entitled &quot;I Don't Like You&quot; with Petrucci and Portnoy backing. In Chaos in Motion tour, in several concerts before &quot;Trial of Tears,&quot; Portnoy and Petrucci would change positions.

In the ''Score'' and ''Chaos in Motion'' DVDs, an animation has accompanied certain parts of the songs, showing the band playing along to the music as cartoon characters. On the Score DVD, during the song [[Octavarium (song)|Octavarium]], the band is seen performing in an octagonal shaped maze.

===Shows and concerts===
Dream Theater played and recorded a live performance at the [[Nippon Budokan Hall]] on April 26, 2004. It was later released as ''[[Live at Budokan (Dream Theater album)|Live at Budokan]]'' on October 5, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metal-archives.com/reviews/Dream_Theater/Live_at_Budokan/53808/ |title=Dream Theater – Live at Budokan – Reviews – Encyclopaedia Metallum |publisher=The Metal Archives |date= |accessdate=January 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dream Theater's largest audience as a headlining act was 20,000 in [[Santiago, Chile]] on December 6, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://voicesuk.net/news.php |title=News |publisher=Voices UK |accessdate=January 30, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205152837/http://voicesuk.net/news.php |archive-date=February 5, 2016 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was during their first tour of [[South American]] countries other than Brazil (which they had visited in 1997 and 1998). The show was released on DVD through Portnoy's YtseJam Records.

In 2007, after their show in Salt Lake City on July 30, Governor [[Jon Huntsman, Jr.]] signed a proclamation officially marking July 30, 2007 as ''Dream Theater Day'' in the state of Utah.

In 2008 Dream Theater started the [[Progressive Nation 2008]] tour, along with [[Opeth]], [[Between the Buried and Me]], and [[3 (American band)|3]]. The tour is the brainchild of Mike Portnoy, who stated, &quot;I've been wanting to assemble a package tour like this for many years now. With all of the festivals and package tours that go through America, I've been talking with our manager and agent for over 10 years now about doing something that focuses on the more progressive, musician-oriented side of hard rock and metal. I decided it was time to stop talking the talk, lace up and finally walk the walk.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Progressive Nation 2008 - Press Release |url=http://www.dreamtheater.net/news_dreamtheater.php#prognation |work=dreamtheater.net |publisher=Dream Theater |date=November 5, 2007 |accessdate=May 11, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510152306/http://www.dreamtheater.net/news_dreamtheater.php |archivedate=May 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 13, 2009, Dream Theater announced the official line up for their [[Progressive Nation 2009]] tour. The tour was originally set to feature bands including Swedish bands [[Beardfish (band)|Beardfish]] and [[Pain of Salvation]], as well as [[Zappa plays Zappa]]. On June 22, 2009, Mike Portnoy announced that Pain of Salvation and Beardfish would not be touring the North American leg of the Progressive Nation 2009 tour because of record label complications. In the same announcement, Portnoy stated that the bands [[Scale the Summit]] and [[Bigelf]] would replace Pain of Salvation and Beardfish on the tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Mark|last=Bredius |url=http://www.dreamtheater.net/news_dreamtheater.php#pnlineup |title=Progressive Nation 2009 North American Tour - Lineup Change |publisher=Dreamtheater.net |accessdate=July 18, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716150250/http://www.dreamtheater.net/news_dreamtheater.php |archivedate=July 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This lineup change has put [[Bigelf]] on both the North American and European legs of the Progressive Nation 2009 tour. The tour's North American leg ran throughout July and August 2009. On March 26, 2009 it was announced that Dream Theater would take the Progressive Nation tour to Europe for the first time alongside Opeth, [[Bigelf]] and [[Unexpect]]. The tour ran throughout September and October 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Mark|last=Bredius |url=http://www.dreamtheater.net/tourdates.php |title=Progressive Nation Tour Dates |publisher=Dreamtheater.net |date=June 14, 2011 |accessdate=July 18, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716150258/http://www.dreamtheater.net/tourdates.php |archivedate=July 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June/July 2010 Dream Theater were the opening band for Iron Maiden during the first leg of their [[The Final Frontier World Tour|Final Frontier Tour]] which included [[Madison Square Garden]] as one of the many venues.  On December 7, 2010, Dream Theater announced on their website that they would be headlining the High Voltage Festival alongside Judas Priest in 2011. In July 2011 they started [[A Dramatic Turn of Events Tour|A Dramatic Tour of Events]] to promote ''[[A Dramatic Turn of Events]]''. In January 2014, they started the Along for the Ride Tour to promote their [[Dream Theater (album)|self-titled album]]. On December 13, 2016, Dream Theater confirmed 5 UK tour dates for their Images, Words &amp; Beyond 25th Anniversary Tour, starting in Birmingham on April 18, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gettothefront.co.uk/2016/12/dream-theater-confirm-uk-dates-25th-anniversary-tour-tickets/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-12-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221064453/http://www.gettothefront.co.uk/2016/12/dream-theater-confirm-uk-dates-25th-anniversary-tour-tickets/ |archivedate=December 21, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logo and imagery==
[[File:Majesty (old name of Dream Theater) (logo).svg|thumb|right|upright|Dream Theater wordmark and &quot;Majesty&quot; symbol]]
Despite the band being forced to change their name, Dream Theater adopted a custom [[logo]] (known as the ''Majesty symbol'') and [[Wordmark (graphic identity)|wordmark]] which has appeared on the vast majority of their promotional material and on the front cover of every Dream Theater studio album. The Majesty symbol is derived from [[Mary, Queen of Scots]]' mark,&lt;ref&gt;The mark used by [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], is available on [http://www.dreamtheater.net/pics/marysymb.jpg DreamTheater.net]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725012406/http://www.dreamtheater.net/pics/marysymb.jpg |date=July 25, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marie-stuart.co.uk/images/sun%20embroidery.jpg |title=An embroidery showing the Mary, Queen of Scots, symbol in use |date= |accessdate=July 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was re-worked by [[Charlie Dominici]] for use on the album artwork for ''[[When Dream and Day Unite]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;What is the 'symbol' DT use&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faq.dtnorway.com/question?questionid=29 |title=What is the 'symbol' DT use? |website=Faq.dtnorway.com |date=November 7, 2003 |accessdate=January 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2010, a fan of Dream Theater discovered that all of the letters of &quot;DOMINICI&quot; fit together perfectly into the Majesty symbol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfdRfcCe_NM |title=What does Dream Theater, Majesty and Dominici have in common? |publisher=YouTube |date=September 13, 2010 |accessdate=September 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Charlie discovered this, he laughed and mentioned that &quot;it only took them 25 years to figure out the 'Dominici Code!'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dominici.com/forum/index.php?topic=421.0 |title=Someone finally figured out the &quot;Dominici Code!&quot; |publisher=DOMINICI.com Forum |date=September 28, 2010 |accessdate=September 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has earlier also been discovered as shown on the comment section of DTFAQ&lt;ref name=&quot;What is the 'symbol' DT use&quot;/&gt; and in the DTNorway Podcast Episode 2 from 2008, with Charlie Dominici.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dtnorway.com/podcast.xml |title=Echo's Hill Podcast |publisher=DTNorway |date= |accessdate=July 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical style==
[[AllMusic]]'s [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] described Dream Theater's music as a &quot;dense blend of [[progressive rock]] and post-[[Van Halen|Halen]] [[heavy metal music|metal]]&quot;.
The band is well noted for being one of the early progenitors of the [[progressive metal]] genre.&lt;ref name= allmusic&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/style/progressive-metal-ma0000002797|title=Progressive Metal|work=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=December 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original members, Mike Portnoy, John Petrucci and John Myung, have strong influences from progressive rock bands such as [[Rush (band)|Rush]], [[Yes (band)|Yes]], and [[Pink Floyd]], heavy metal bands such as [[Iron Maiden]] and [[Judas Priest]], various [[speed metal]] bands, and even the [[glam metal]] of the day.&lt;ref name=rhap&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rhapsody.com/dream-theater|last=York|first=Will|work=[[Rhapsody (online music service)|Rhapsody]]|title=Dream Theater|accessdate=December 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This synthesis created a unique metal that was not traditional of the day: it had distorted guitars and fast riffing, but the music focused more on technical proficiency and precise execution than on heavy metal riffs. The band's music has focused on three main elements: metal, melody, and progressive roots.&lt;ref name= utube&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbhILPW80A|title=Dream Theater – Interview – part 1|last=Portnoy|first=Mike|work=TheCrookedStep.com|accessdate=December 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Mike Portnoy has also stated that the band's slower songs are in appreciation of artists such as [[Peter Gabriel]], [[U2]], and [[Journey (band)|Journey]].&lt;ref&gt;Greatest Hit (...And 21 Other Pretty Cool Songs) booklet liner notes.&lt;/ref&gt;
Dream Theater's music has also been described as [[art rock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite_book|title=Legends of Rock Guitar: The Essential Reference of Rock's Greatest Guitarists|author=Pete Prown, Harvey P.

[[File:Subgenius-JHVH-1-by-St-Ken.jpg|thumb|[[Jehovah&amp;nbsp;1]], the primary deity of the Church of the SubGenius.]]
The '''Church of the SubGenius''' is a [[parody religion]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Solomon |first1=Dan |title=The Church of the SubGenius Finally Plays It Straight |url=https://www.texasmonthly.com/the-daily-post/the-church-of-the-subgenius-finally-plays-it-straight/ |website=[[Texas Monthly]] |accessdate=19 May 2019 |language=en |date=2 November 2017|quote='''Dan Solomon:''' The SubGenius has been a put-on for so long. What's it like to drop that mask and tell the story in a real way now? '''Ivan Stang:''' It's fun for me. I've been keeping a straight face for thirty-five years. Your face gets tired. I really would not drop character for a long, long time.}}&lt;/ref&gt; that satirizes better-known belief systems. It teaches a complex philosophy that focuses on [[J. R. &quot;Bob&quot; Dobbs]], purportedly a salesman from the 1950s, who is revered as a prophet by the Church. SubGenius leaders have developed detailed narratives about Dobbs and his relationship to various gods and conspiracies. Their central deity, [[Jehovah&amp;nbsp;1]], is accompanied by other gods drawn from ancient myth and popular fiction. SubGenius literature describes a grand conspiracy that seeks to brainwash the world and oppress Dobbs's followers. In its narratives, the Church presents a blend of cultural references in an elaborate remix of the sources.

[[Ivan Stang]], who co-founded the Church in the 1970s, serves as its leader and publicist. He has imitated actions of other religious leaders, using the tactic of [[culture jamming]] in an attempt to undermine better-known faiths. Church leaders instruct their followers to avoid mainstream commercialism and the belief in [[absolute truth]]s. The group holds that the quality of &quot;Slack&quot; is of utmost importance, but it is never clearly defined. The number of followers is unknown, although the Church's message has been welcomed by college students and artists in the United States. The group is often compared to [[Discordianism]]. Journalists often consider the Church an elaborate joke, but some academics have defended it as a real system of deeply held beliefs.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=84}}{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=43}}

==Origins==
The Church of the SubGenius was founded by [[Ivan Stang]] (born Douglas St Clair Smith) and Philo Drummond (born Steve Wilcox){{sfn|Chryssides|2012|p=95}} as the SubGenius Foundation.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=83}} Dr. X (born Monte Dhooge) was also present at the group's inception.{{sfn|Shea|2006}} The organization's first recorded activity was the publication of a photocopied document, ''Sub Genius Pamphlet #1'', disseminated in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]] in 1979. The document announced the impending end of the world and the possible deaths of its readers.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=83}} It criticized Christian conceptions of God and [[New Age]] perceptions of spirituality.{{sfn|Niesel|2000}}

Church leaders maintain that a man named [[J. R. &quot;Bob&quot; Dobbs]] founded the group in 1953.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=83}} SubGenius members constructed an elaborate account of Dobbs's life, which commentators describe as fictional.{{sfn|Kinsella|2011|p=67}} They assert that he telepathically contacted Drummond in 1972, before meeting him in person the next year, and that Drummond persuaded Stang to join shortly afterward.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=86}} Stang has called himself Dobbs's &quot;sacred scribe&quot; and a &quot;professional maven of weirdness&quot;.{{sfn|Batz|1995}}{{sfn|Giffels|1995}}

==Beliefs==

===Deities===
The Church of the SubGenius's ostensible beliefs defy categorization or a simple narrative, often striking outsiders as bizarre and convoluted.{{sfn|Batz|1995}} The group has an intricate mythology involving gods, aliens, and mutants, which observers usually consider satire of other religions.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=83}} Its primary deity, generally known as Jehovah&amp;nbsp;1,{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=84}} is an extraterrestrial who contacted Dobbs in the 1950s. Various accounts state that the encounter occurred while Dobbs was building a television or watching late-night television.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=85}}{{sfn|Rea|1985}} Jehovah&amp;nbsp;1 gave him supernatural knowledge of the past and future, in addition to incredible power.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=85}} Dobbs then posed deep questions to the alien, receiving mysterious answers.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=102}} Some of their discussion centered on a powerful conspiracy, to which the Church attributes command of the world.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=84}}

Jehovah&amp;nbsp;1 and his spouse [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]], regarded by the Church as &quot;relatively evil&quot;, are classified as &quot;rebel gods&quot;.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|pp=86 &amp; 101}} SubGenius leaders note that Jehovah&amp;nbsp;1 is wrathful, a quality expressed by his &quot;stark fist of removal&quot;.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=86}} The Church teaches that they are part of the Elder Gods, who are committed to human pain, but that Jehovah&amp;nbsp;1 is &quot;relatively good&quot; in comparison. [[Yog-Sothoth]], a character from [[H. P. Lovecraft]]'s [[Cthulhu Mythos]], is the Elder Gods' leader. In her 2010 study of the Church of the SubGenius, religious scholar Carole Cusack of the [[University of Sydney]] states that Lovecraft's work is a &quot;model for the Church of the SubGenius's approach to scripture&quot;, in that aspects of his fiction were treated as real by some within paganism, just as the Church appropriates aspects of popular culture in its spirituality.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=101}}

===J. R. &quot;Bob&quot; Dobbs===
{{Main|J. R. &quot;Bob&quot; Dobbs}}
[[File:June and Ward Cleaver Leave it to Beaver 1958.JPG|thumb|Fictional character [[Ward Cleaver]] (right), to whom Dobbs' appearance is often compared.]]

SubGenius leaders teach that Dobbs's nature is ineffable and consequently stylize his name with quotation marks.{{sfn|Hart|1992}}{{sfn|Leiby|1994}} They call him a &quot;World Avatar&quot;{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=86}} and hold that he has died and been reborn many times.{{sfn|Batz|1995}} The Church's primary symbol is an icon of his face in which he smokes a pipe.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=84}} Stang has said the image was taken from [[Yellow Pages]] clip art,{{sfn|Hart|1992}} and it has been likened to [[Ward Cleaver]],{{sfn|Batz|1995}} [[Mark Trail]],{{sfn|Rea|1985}} or a 1950s-era salesman.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=84}} The Church's canon contains references to aspects of United States culture in that decade;{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=88}} religious scholar Danielle Kirby of [[RMIT University]] argues that this type of reference &quot;simultaneously critiques and subverts&quot; the [[American dream]].{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=50}}

In the Church's mythology, Jehovah&amp;nbsp;1 intended Dobbs to lead a powerful conspiracy and brainwash individuals to make them work for a living. Dobbs refused; instead, he infiltrated the group and organized a counter-movement. Church leaders teach that he was a very intelligent child and, as he grew older, studied several religious traditions, including [[Sufism]], [[Rosicrucianism]], and the [[Fourth Way]].{{sfn|Cusack|2010|pp=84–6}} Another key event in his life occurred when he traveled to [[Tibet]], where he learned vital truths about topics including [[Yeti]]s; the Church teaches that SubGenius members are descended from them. The only relative of Dobbs the Church identifies is his mother, Jane McBride Dobbs—Church leaders cite his lack of resemblance to his mother's husband as the reason for not revealing his father.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|pp=84–6}} Dobbs is married to a woman named [[J. R. &quot;Bob&quot; Dobbs#Connie Dobbs|Connie]]; SubGenius leaders identify the couple as archetypes of the genders in a belief that resembles Hindu doctrines about [[Shiva]] and [[Parvati]].{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=85}} Church literature has variously described Dobbs's occupation as &quot;drilling equipment&quot; or [[fluoride]] sales,{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=86}}{{sfn|Rea|1985}} and accounts of his life generally emphasize his good fortune rather than intelligence.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=88}} SubGenius leaders believe he is capable of time travel, and that this results in occasional changes to doctrine (the &quot;Sacred Doctrine of Erasability&quot;). Consequently, members attempt to follow Dobbs by eschewing unchangeable plans.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=88}}

==={{anchor|slack}}Conspiracy and &quot;Slack&quot;===
The Church of the SubGenius's literature incorporates many aspects of conspiracy theories,{{sfn|Davidoff|2003|p=170}} teaching that there is a grand conspiracy at the root of all lesser ones.{{sfn|Hart|1992}} It says that there are many UFOs, most of which are used by the conspiracy leaders to monitor humans, though a few contain extraterrestrials. In the Church's view, this conspiracy uses a façade of empowering messages but manipulates people so that they become indoctrinated into its service.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=86}} The Church calls these individuals &quot;pinks&quot; and states that they are blissfully unaware of the organization's power and control.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=93}} SubGenius leaders teach that most cultural and religious mores are the conspiracy's propaganda.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=88}} They maintain that their followers, but not the pinks, are capable of developing an imagination; the Church teaches that Dobbs has empowered its members to see through these illusions. Owing to their descent from Yetis, the Church's followers have a capacity for deep understanding that the pinks lack.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=86}} [[Cultural studies]] scholar Solomon Davidoff states that the Church develops a &quot;satiric commentary&quot; on religion, morality, and conspiracies.{{sfn|Davidoff|2003|p=170}}

SubGenius members believe that those in the service of the conspiracy seek to bar them from &quot;Slack&quot;,{{sfn|Davidoff|2003|p=170}} a quality promoted by the Church. Its teachings center on &quot;Slack&quot;{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=83}} (always capitalized),{{sfn|Leiby|1994}} which is never concisely defined, though Dobbs is said to embody it.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=84}}{{sfn|Duncombe|2005|p=222}} Church members seek to acquire Slack and believe it will allow them the free, comfortable life (without hard work or responsibility) they claim as an entitlement.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=85}}{{sfn|Duncombe|2005|p=226}} Sex and the avoidance of work are taught as two key ways to gain Slack.{{sfn|Leiby|1994}} Davidoff believes that Slack is &quot;the ability to effortlessly achieve your goals&quot;.{{sfn|Davidoff|2003|p=170}} Cusack states that the Church's description of Slack as ineffable recalls the way that [[Tao]] is described,{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=86}} and Kirby calls Slack a &quot;unique magical system&quot;.{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=49}}

==Members==
[[File:Robert Crumb 2010.jpg|thumb|[[Robert Crumb|R. Crumb]], a cartoonist who helped publicize the Church.]]
The Church of the SubGenius's founders were based in Dallas when they distributed their first document. The SubGenius Foundation moved to [[Cleveland]], Ohio, in 1999.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=83}} In 2009, Stang claimed the Church had 40,000&amp;nbsp;members, but the actual number may have been much lower.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=106}} As of 2012, becoming a minister in the Church consists of paying a $35&amp;nbsp;fee;{{sfn|SubGenius.com Sales}} Stang has estimated that there are 10,000&amp;nbsp;ministers{{sfn|Rea|1985}}{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=90}}{{sfn|Scoblionkov|1998}} and that the Church's annual income has reached $100,000.{{sfn|Niesel|2000}} In October 2017, The Church moved to [[Glen Rose, Texas|Glen Rose]], Texas.

Most SubGenius members are male,{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=102}} and, according to Stang, many are social outcasts.{{sfn|Giffels|1995}} He maintains that those who do not fit into society will ultimately triumph over those who do.{{sfn|Niesel|2000}} The Church has experienced success &quot;converting&quot; college students,{{sfn|Batz|1995}} particularly at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].{{sfn|Yuen|1998}} It has also gained popularity in several American cities, including [[San Francisco]], [[Little Rock]], and Cleveland.{{sfn|Giffels|1995}}{{sfn|Ashbrook|1988}} A few Church members have voiced concerns and/or amusement about new members who took the Church too seriously, fearing that they acted like serious cult followers, the very concept the SubGenius parodies.{{sfn|Rea|1985}} Stang has expressed concern that the Church's doctrines could exacerbate preexisting [[psychosis|psychoses]] of mentally ill devotees, although he believes that the Church genuinely helps many adherents.{{sfn|Giffels|1995}}

Notable associates of the Church include [[Mark Mothersbaugh]],{{sfn|Leiby|1994}} [[Mojo Nixon]],{{sfn|Leiby|1994}} [[Paul Mavrides]],{{sfn|Giffels|1995}} [[Paul Reubens]],{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=94}} members of [[Negativland]],{{sfn|Leiby|1994}} [[David Byrne]], and [[Robert Crumb|R.&amp;nbsp;Crumb]].{{sfn|Callahan|1996}} Crumb provided early publicity for the church by reprinting ''Sub Genius Pamphlet #1'' in his comics anthology ''[[Weirdo (magazine)|Weirdo]]''.{{sfn|Niesel|2000}} References to the Church are present in several works of art,{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=111}} including the Internet-based [[collaborative fiction]] ''[[Ong's Hat]]'', the comic book ''[[The Middleman]]'', the band [[Sublime (band)|Sublime]]'s album ''[[40oz. to Freedom]]'', and the television program ''[[Pee-wee's Playhouse]]''.{{sfn|Kinsella|2011|p=64–7}}{{sfn|Lloyd|2008}}{{sfn|Knight|2012|p=96}}

===Instructions===
Church leaders have issued specific instructions to their followers;{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=89}} Robert Latham of the [[University of California, Riverside]], calls their ideology &quot;anarcholibertarian&quot;.{{sfn|Latham|2002|p=94}} Five specific commands particularly embody the group's values:

*Shun regular employment and stop working. This encapsulates the Church's view that to repent is to &quot;SLACK OFF&quot;,{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=89}} as opposed to working for a living.{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=50}} SubGenius leaders say it is permissible for members to collect public assistance in lieu of maintaining employment.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=89}}
*Purchase products sold by the Church, which its leaders say Dobbs founded to gain wealth.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=87}} Unlike most religious groups, the Church proudly admits it is for-profit (presumably mocking religious groups that seem to have ulterior financial motives).{{sfn|Leiby|1994}} Cusack sees the instruction to buy as an ironic parody of the &quot;[[Wall Street (1987 film)|greed is good]]&quot; mentality of the 1980s,{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=89}} and Kirby notes that although the group emphasizes &quot;the consumption of popular cultural artefacts&quot;, this consumption is &quot;simultaneously de-emphasized by the processes of remix&quot;.{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=52}}
*Rebel against &quot;law and order&quot;. Specifically, the Church condemns security cameras and encourages computer hacking. Cusack notes that this instruction recalls [[Robert Anton Wilson]]'s critique of law and order.
*Rid the world of everyone who did not descend from [[Yeti]]s.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=89}} SubGenius leaders teach that Dobbs hopes to rid the Earth of 90% of humanity, making the Earth &quot;clear&quot;.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=87}} The group praises drug abuse and abortion as effective methods of culling unneeded individuals.
*Exploit fear, specifically that of people who are part of the conspiracy. Church leaders teach conspiracy members fear SubGenius devotees.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=89}}

==Events==

===Devivals===
[[File:Klaatu.JPG|thumb|[[Klaatu (The Day the Earth Stood Still)|Klaatu]], a character from the 1951 American science fiction film ''[[The Day the Earth Stood Still]]'', who is celebrated by the Church of the SubGenius.]]
Local groups of members of the Church of the SubGenius are known as &quot;clenches&quot;. They host periodic events known as &quot;devivals&quot;, which include sermons, music, and other art forms.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=83}} The term is used by both the [[Church of the Subgenius]] and [[Discordianism]]{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} for a gathering or festival of followers. The name is a pun on [[Christian revival]]s.&lt;ref name=Cusack&gt;{{citation

  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At devivals, leaders take comical names and give angry rants.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=93}} Many take place at bars or similar venues.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=106}} Cusack compares the style of the services to [[Pentecostal]] [[revivalism]];{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=93}} David Giffels of the ''[[Akron Beacon Journal]]'' calls them &quot;campy preaching sessions&quot;.{{sfn|Giffels|1995}} Cusack posits that these events are examples of [[Peter Lamborn Wilson]]'s concept of [[Temporary Autonomous Zone]]s, spaces in which the ordinary constraints of social control are suspended.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=97}} On one occasion, the presence of a Church leader's wife at a SubGenius meeting that included public nudity and a goat costume contributed to her losing custody of her children in a court case. But the publicity surrounding the event was a boon to the Church's recruitment efforts.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=107}}

The Church also celebrates several holidays in honor of characters from fiction and popular culture, such as [[Monty Python]], [[Dracula]], and [[Klaatu (The Day the Earth Stood Still)|Klaatu]].{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=104}} The [[Association for Consciousness Exploration]] and pagan groups have occasionally assisted the Church in its events.{{sfn|Leiby|1994}}{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=106}} Some SubGenius members put little emphasis on meetings, citing the Church's focus on individualism, though the ''Book of the SubGenius'' discusses community.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|pp=98–9}}

SubGenius devivals are not regularly scheduled, but are recorded on the SubGenius website.&lt;ref name=DevivalHistory&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.subgenius.com/bigfist/fun/devivals/devivals.html|title=Reports on Great Devivals of yore}}&lt;/ref&gt; Devivals have been held in multiple U.S. states, as well as China, the Netherlands, and Germany. The Church has also held Devivals at non-SubGenius events, such as [[Burning Man]] and the [[Starwood Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = SubSite - Past Events|url = http://www.subgenius.com/bigfist/fun/devivals/devivals.html|website = www.subgenius.com|accessdate = 2015-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The &quot;Go Fuck Yourself&quot; devival was held in [[Astoria, New York]], in October 2010 by the Church of the Subgenius at the Wonderland Collective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newyorkcity.eventful.com/events/subgenius-devival-/E0-001-034012941-7|title=SUBGENIUS DEVIVAL IN ASTORIA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===X-Day===
In early SubGenius literature, July 5, 1998, was introduced as a significant date, later becoming known as &quot;[[X-Day (Church of the SubGenius)|X-Day]]&quot;.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=89}} The Church held that Dobbs identified the date's significance in the 1950s,{{sfn|Scoblionkov|1998}} claiming that the world was to experience a massive change on that date when Xists, beings from Planet&amp;nbsp;X, would arrive on Earth.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=90}} SubGenius leaders said their paying members would be transported onto spaceships for union with goddesses as the world was destroyed,{{sfn|Gunn|Beard|2000|p=269}} though a few posited that they would be sent to a joyful hell.{{sfn|Giffels|1995}} In anticipation of the event, X-Day &quot;drills&quot; were held in 1996 and 1997.{{sfn|SubGenius.com Devivals}}

In July 1998, the Church held a large devival at a &quot;clothing-optional&quot; campground in [[Sherman, New York]],{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=90}}{{sfn|Yuen|1998}} attended by about 400&amp;nbsp;members.{{sfn|Scoblionkov|1998}} The event was ostensibly to celebrate the coming of aliens. When their appearance was not detected using the technology available at the time, Stang speculated that they might arrive in 8661, an inversion of 1998;{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=90}} this has been interpreted as a satire of the way that religious groups have revised prophecies after their failures.{{sfn|Gunn|Beard|2000|p=269}} Some critics have dismissed the event as a prank or &quot;performance art&quot;.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=90}} Another theory is that The Conspiracy has lied about what year the present year actually is (just as they have lied about everything else), so that the liberation date would seem to pass without fulfillment and cause followers to lose faith. As a precaution, SubGenius members continue to gather for X-Day every July 5. At these events, the non-appearance of the aliens is celebrated.{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=49}}{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=98}} Cusack calls the productions [[carnivalesque]]{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=98}} or an echo of ancient Greek [[satyr play]]s.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=90}}

==Publishing==

=== Online ===
The Church of the SubGenius established a website in May 1993,{{sfn|Ciolek|2003|p=800}} and its members were very active on [[Usenet]] in the 1990s.{{sfn|Batz|1995}}

=== Print ===
Although it has gained a significant online presence, it was successful before the advent of Internet communities.{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=44}} The Church was a pioneer in the religious use of [[zine]]s;{{sfn|Kinsella|2011|p=64}} Cusack notes that its use of the medium can be seen as a rejection of the alienation of labor practices.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=100}}

The SubGenius Foundation has published several official teachings, as well as non-doctrinal works by Stang.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=83}} The ''Book of the SubGenius'', which discusses Slack at length, was published by [[Simon&amp;nbsp;&amp; Schuster]] and sold 30,000&amp;nbsp;copies in its first five years in print.{{sfn|Ashbrook|1988}}{{sfn|Stein|1993|p=179}} Kirby calls it a &quot;call to arms for the forces of absurdity&quot;.{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=49}} Its juxtaposition, visual style, and content mirror the group as a whole.{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=51}} It draws themes from fiction as well as established and new religions, parodying a number of topics, including the Church of the SubGenius itself.{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=49}}

A number of SubGenius members have written stories to build their mythology, which have been compiled and published.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=100}} Their core texts are disordered, presented in the style of a collage.{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=48}} Kirby notes that the group's texts are a [[bricolage]] of cultural artifacts remixed into a new creation.{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=50}}{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=51}} In this process, Kirby argues, they interweave and juxtapose a variety of concepts, which she calls a &quot;web of references&quot;.{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=50}}

=== Video ===
The group has also been promoted by a video Stang produced in 1992.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=83}}{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=49}}

=== Radio ===
The Church of the SubGenius hosts several radio shows throughout the world, including broadcasters in Atlanta, Ohio, Maryland, and California. Several radio stations in the United States and two in Canada broadcast ''[[Hour of Slack|The Hour of Slack]]'', the Church’s most popular audio production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = SubSite - Radio|url = http://www.subgenius.com/ts/hos.html|website = www.subgenius.com|accessdate = 2015-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Podcast ===
''[[Hour of Slack|The Hour of Slack]]'' can also be heard in podcast form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = SubSite - Radio|url = http://www.subgenius.com/ts/hos.html|website = www.subgenius.com|accessdate = 2018-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = hourofslack.libsyn.com|url = http://hourofslack.libsyn.com|accessdate = 2018-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis and commentary==

===Comparative religion===
The Church's teachings are often perceived as satirizing Christianity and Scientology,{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=84}} earning them a reputation as a [[parody religion]].{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=83}} Church leaders have said that Dobbs met [[L.&amp;nbsp;Ron Hubbard]], and SubGenius narratives echo [[Space opera in Scientology|extraterrestrial themes found in Scientology]].{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=105}} Cusack notes Jehovah 1 bears noticeable similarities to [[Xenu]], a powerful alien found in some Scientologist writings.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=87}} The Church's rhetoric has also been seen as a satirical imitation of the [[televangelism]] of the 1980s.{{sfn|Callahan|1996}} Cusack sees the Church's faux commercialism as [[culture jamming]] targeting [[prosperity theology]],{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=104}} calling it &quot;a strikingly original innovation in contemporary religion&quot;.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=111}} Religious scholar Thomas Alberts of the [[University of London]] views the Church as attempting to &quot;subvert the idea of authenticity in religion&quot; by mirroring other religions to create a sense of both similarity and [[alterity]].{{sfn|Alberts|2008|p=127}}

Cusack compares the Church of the SubGenius to the [[Ranter]]s, a radical 17th-century pantheist movement in England that made statements that shocked many hearers, attacking traditional notions of religious orthodoxy and political authority. In her view, this demonstrates that the Church of the SubGenius has &quot;legitimate pedigree in the history of Western religion&quot;.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|pp=106–7}} The American journalist [[Michael Muhammad Knight]] likens the Church to the [[Moorish Orthodox Church of America]], a 20th-century American [[syncretism|syncretic]] religious movement, citing their shared emphasis on freedom.{{sfn|Knight|2012|p=96}}

There are a number of similarities between the Church of the SubGenius and [[Discordianism]]. Eris, the goddess of chaos worshiped by adherents of the latter, is believed by members of the Church of the SubGenius to be Jehovah&amp;nbsp;1's wife and an ally to humans. Like Discordianism, the Church of the SubGenius rejects absolute truth and embraces contradictions and paradoxes.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=88}} Religious scholar David Chidester of the [[University of Cape Town]] views the Church as a &quot;Discordian offshoot&quot;,{{sfn|Chidester|2005|p=198}} and Kirby sees it as &quot;a child of the Discordians&quot;.{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=48}} Both groups were heavily influenced by the writings of [[Robert Anton Wilson]], whom SubGenius members call &quot;Pope Bob&quot;.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=88}}{{sfn|''The Daily Telegraph'', &quot;Robert Anton Wilson&quot;}} Kirby states that the two groups have elements of bricolage and absurdity in common, but the Church of the SubGenius more explicitly remixes pop culture.{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=49}}

===Categorization===
Scholars often have difficulty defining the Church.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=109}} Most commentators have placed the Church in the category of &quot;joke religions&quot;, which is usually seen as pejorative. Kirby sees this categorization as partially accurate because irony is an essential aspect of the faith.{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=43}} Other terms used to describe the Church include &quot;faux cult&quot;,{{sfn|Callahan|1996}} &quot;[postmodern] cult&quot;,{{sfn|Batz|1995}} &quot;satirical pseudoreligion&quot;,{{sfn|Stein|1993|p=179}} &quot;sophisticated joke religion&quot;,{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=109}} &quot;anti-religion religion&quot;,{{sfn|Scoblionkov|1998}} and &quot;high parody of cultdom&quot;.{{sfn|Rea|1985}} Members of the Church, however, have consistently maintained that they practice a religion.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=98}} Stang has described the group as both &quot;satire and a real stupid religion&quot;, and contends that it is more honest about its nature than are other religions.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=107}}

Cusack states that the Church &quot;must be accorded the status of a functional equivalent of religion, at the very least, if not 'authentic' religion&quot;.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=84}} She sees it as &quot;arguably a legitimate path to liberation&quot;, citing its culture jamming and activism against commercialism.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=84}} Kirby posits that the Church is a religion masquerading as a joke, rather than the reverse: in her view, it is a spiritual manifestation of a cultural shift toward irony.{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=43}} Alberts believes there is broad agreement that the Church is fundamentally a different type of group than religions that date to antiquity; he prefers to use the term &quot;fake religion&quot; to describe it. He sees it, along with Discordianism, as part of a group of &quot;popular movements that look and feel like religion, but whose apparent excess, irreverence and arbitrariness seem to mock religion&quot;.{{sfn|Alberts|2008|p=126}} Knight characterizes the Church as &quot;at once a postmodern spoof of religion and a viable system in its own right&quot;.{{sfn|Knight|2012|p=96}}

===Appraisal===
Kirby argues that the Church forms a counterpart to [[Jean Baudrillard]]'s concept of [[hyperreality]], arguing, &quot;they create, rather than consume, popular culture in the practice of their spirituality&quot;.{{sfn|Kirby|2012|pp=42–3}} She calls their remixing of popular culture sources an &quot;explicitly creative process&quot;,{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=50}} maintaining that it prompts the reader to adopt some of the group's views by forcing &quot;the individual to reconsider normative methods of approaching the content&quot;.{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=50}} She states that the group attempts to &quot;strip references of their original meaning without necessarily losing their status as icons&quot;.{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=50}}

Kirby also sees the Church's goal as deconstructing &quot;normative modes of thought and behavior&quot; in American culture;{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=44}} she believes that it attempts to fight culturally ingrained thought patterns by shocking people.{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=49}} She argues that traditional approaches to religion cast seriousness as a measure of devotion, an approach she believes has failed in contemporary society. She feels that irony is a common value that most religions have ignored. By embracing the quality, she maintains, the Church of the SubGenius offers a more accessible worldview than many groups.{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=43}}

Literature scholar Paul Mann of [[Pomona College]] is critical of the Church of the SubGenius. He notes that the Church purports to present the truth through absurdity and faults it for insufficiently examining the concept of truth itself.{{sfn|Mann|1999|p=156}} In addition, he believes that the group undermines its attempts to take a radical perspective with its &quot;hysterical, literal, fantastic embrace&quot; of criticism.{{sfn|Mann|1999|p=158}}

Anarchist writer [[Bob Black]], a former member, has criticized the Church, alleging that it has become conformist and submissive to authority. He believes that although it initially served to satirize cults, it later took on some of their aspects. In 1992, allegations of cultlike behavior also appeared in the newspaper ''[[Bedfordshire on Sunday]]'' after a spate of SubGenius-themed vandalism struck the English town of [[Bedford]].{{sfn|Leiby|1994}}

'''St Albans Cathedral''', officially the '''Cathedral and Abbey Church of St Alban'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.stalbanscathedral.org/|title=Home - The Cathedral and Abbey Church of Saint Alban|website=www.stalbanscathedral.org|access-date=6 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110306090553/http://www.stalbanscathedral.org/|archive-date=6 March 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; but often referred to locally as &quot;the Abbey&quot;, is a [[Church of England]] cathedral in [[St Albans]], [[England]]. Much of its architecture dates from [[Normans|Norman]] times. It ceased to be an [[abbey]] following its dissolution in the 16th century and became a cathedral in 1877. Although legally a cathedral church, it differs in certain particulars from most other cathedrals in England: it is also used as a parish church, of which the [[Dean (Christianity)|dean]] is [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] with the same powers, responsibilities and duties as that of any other [[Ecclesiastical parish|parish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19494|title=Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Saint AlbansWith an Account of the Fabric &amp; a Short History of the Abbey|first=Thomas|last=Perkins|date=8 October 2006|publisher=|via=Project Gutenberg|access-date=28 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190301013436/http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19494|archive-date=1 March 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 85 metres long, it has the longest [[nave]] of any cathedral in England.&lt;ref name=&quot;stalbanscathedral.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.stalbanscathedral.org/visit/what-to-see/|title=Highlights - The Cathedral and Abbey Church of Saint Alban|website=www.stalbanscathedral.org|access-date=7 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190308082150/https://www.stalbanscathedral.org/visit/what-to-see/|archive-date=8 March 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Probably founded in the 8th century, the present building is Norman or [[Romanesque architecture]] of the 11th century, with Gothic and 19th-century additions.

==Britain's first Christian martyr==
{{Main|Saint Alban}}

According to [[Bede]], whose account of the saint's life is the most elaborate, Alban lived in [[Verulamium]], some time during the 3rd or 4th centuries.  At that time Christians began to suffer &quot;cruel persecution.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot; /&gt; Alban met a Christian priest (known as Amphibalus) fleeing from &quot;persecutors,&quot; and sheltered him in his house for a number of days. Alban was so impressed with the priest's faith and piety that he soon converted to Christianity. Eventually Roman soldiers came to seize the priest, but Alban put on his cloak and presented himself to the soldiers in place of his guest.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Bede|title=Ecclesiastical History of the English People|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/bede-book1.asp|work=Internet History Sourcebook|publisher=Fordham University|accessdate=3 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104205602/http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/bede-book1.asp|archive-date=4 November 2013|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alban was brought before a judge and was sentenced to beheading.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot; /&gt; As he was led to execution, he came to a fast flowing river, commonly believed to be the [[River Ver]]), crossed it and went about 500 paces to a gently sloping hill overlooking a beautiful plain&lt;ref name=&quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot; /&gt; When he reached the summit he began to thirst and prayed that God would give him drink, whereupon water sprang up at his feet. It was at this place that his head was struck off. Immediately after one of the executioners delivered the fatal stroke, his eyes fell out and dropped to the ground alongside Alban's head.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot; /&gt; Later versions of the tale say that Alban's head rolled downhill and that a well gushed up where it stopped.&lt;ref name=&quot;Medieval St Albans&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Medieval St Albans|url=http://www.salbani.co.uk/Med%20Web/holywell_hill.htm|accessdate=3 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130918084138/http://www.salbani.co.uk/Med%20Web/holywell_hill.htm|archive-date=18 September 2013|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; St Albans Cathedral stands near the supposed site of Alban's martyrdom, and references to the spontaneous well are extant in local place names. The nearby river was called Halywell (Middle English for 'Holy Well') in the medieval era, and the road up to Holmhurst Hill on which the Abbey now stands is now called Holywell Hill but has been called Halliwell Street and other variations at least since the 13th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Medieval St Albans&quot;/&gt; The remains of a well structure have been found at the bottom of Holywell Hill. However, this well is thought to date from no earlier than the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salbani.co.uk/Med%20Web/holywell_hill.htm|title=Holywell Hill|publisher=salbani.co.uk|accessdate=2009-11-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130918084138/http://www.salbani.co.uk/Med%20Web/holywell_hill.htm|archive-date=18 September 2013|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The date of Alban's execution has never been firmly established. The ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' lists the year 283,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/files/657/657.txt | title = Anglo-Saxon Chronicles | publisher = [[Project Gutenberg]] | access-date = 10 June 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180612142020/http://www.gutenberg.org/files/657/657.txt | archive-date = 12 June 2018 | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Bede]] places it in 305. Original sources and modern historians such as [[William Hugh Clifford Frend]] and [[Charles Thomas (historian)|Charles Thomas]] indicate the period of 251–259 (under the persecutors Decius or Valerian) as more likely.

The tomb of St Amphibalus is in the cathedral.

==History of the abbey and cathedral==
{{details|list of abbots of St Albans Abbey}}
[[File:St Albans cathedral - cloisters - PS01.JPG|thumb|Remains of the cathedral's [[cloister]]s.]]

A ''memoria'' over the execution point holding the remains of Alban existed at the site from the mid-4th century (possibly earlier); [[Bede]] mentions a church and [[Gildas]] a shrine. Bishop [[Germanus of Auxerre]] visited in 429.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.stalbanscathedral.org/history/story-of-st-alban|title=Story of St Alban - The Cathedral and Abbey Church of Saint Alban|website=www.stalbanscathedral.org|access-date=10 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612141942/https://www.stalbanscathedral.org/history/story-of-st-alban|archive-date=12 June 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The style of this structure is unknown; the 13th-century [[English historians in the Middle Ages|chronicler]] [[Matthew Paris]] (see below) claimed that the Saxons destroyed the building in 586.

===Saxon buildings===
[[Offa]] II of [[Mercia]], is said to have founded a [[double monastery]] at St Albans in 793. It followed the [[Benedictine]] rule.&lt;ref name=tma&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.stalbanscathedral.org/history/monastic-site|title=The Medieval Abbey - The Cathedral and Abbey Church of Saint Alban|website=www.stalbanscathedral.org|access-date=10 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180925092518/https://www.stalbanscathedral.org/history/monastic-site|archive-date=25 September 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Abbey was built on Holmhurst Hill — now Holywell Hill — across the [[River Ver]] from the ruins of Verulamium. Again there is no information to the form of the first abbey. The Abbey was probably sacked by the Danes around 890 and, despite Paris's claims, the office of abbot remained empty from around 920 until the 970s when the efforts of [[Dunstan]] reached the town.

There was an intention to rebuild the Abbey in 1005 when Abbot Ealdred was licensed to remove building material from Verulamium. With the town resting on clay and chalk the only tough stone is [[flint]]. This was used with a lime [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] and then either [[plaster]]ed over or left bare. With the great quantities of brick, tile and other stone in Verulamium, the Roman site became a prime source of building material for the Abbey and other projects in the area. Sections demanding worked stone used [[Lincolnshire]] [[limestone]] ([[Barnack stone]]) from Verulamium; later worked stones include [[Totternhoe Stone|Totternhoe]] [[freestone (masonry)|freestone]] from [[Bedfordshire]], [[Purbeck marble]], and different limestones ([[Ancaster stone|Ancaster]], [[Chilmark Quarries|Chilmark]], [[Clipsham]], etc.).

Renewed Viking raids from 1016 stalled the Saxon efforts and very little from the Saxon abbey was incorporated in the later forms.

===Norman abbey===
Much of the current layout and proportions of the [[St Albans Abbey|structure]] date from the first [[Normans|Norman]] abbot, [[Paul of Caen]] (1077–1093).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/herts/vol2/pp483-488|title=St Albans abbey: History - British History Online|website=www.british-history.ac.uk|access-date=28 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190301074619/https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/herts/vol2/pp483-488|archive-date=1 March 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 14th abbot, he was appointed by his uncle, the new [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Lanfranc]].

Building work started in the year of Abbot Paul's arrival. The design and construction was overseen by the Norman Robert the Mason. The plan has very limited Anglo-Saxon elements and is clearly influenced by the French work at [[Cluny]], [[Bernay, Eure|Bernay]] and [[Caen]], and shares a similar floor plan to [[Abbey of Saint-Étienne, Caen|Saint-Étienne]] and Lanfranc's Canterbury — although the poorer quality building material was a new challenge for Robert and he clearly borrowed some Roman techniques, which were learned while gathering material in Verulamium.
To take maximum use of the hilltop the Abbey was oriented to the south-east. The [[cruciform]] abbey was the largest built in England at that time, it had a [[chancel]] of four bays, a [[transept]] containing seven [[apse]]s, and a [[nave]] of ten bays — fifteen bays long overall. Robert gave particular attention to solid [[foundation (architecture)|foundation]]s, running a continuous wall of layered bricks, flints and mortar below and pushing the foundations down to twelve feet to hit bedrock. Below the [[crossing tower]] special large stones were used.

The tower was a particular triumph — it is the only 11th-century great crossing tower still standing in England. Robert began with special thick supporting walls and four massive brick piers. The four-level tower tapers at each stage with clasping buttresses on the three lower levels and circular buttresses on the fourth stage. The entire structure masses 5,000 tons and is 144 feet high. The tower was probably topped with a Norman pyramidal roof; the current roof is flat. The original ringing chamber had five bells — two paid for by the Abbot, two by a wealthy townsman, and one donated by the rector of [[Hoddesdon]]. None of these bells has survived.

There was a widespread belief that the Abbey had two additional, smaller towers at the west end. No remains have been found.

The monastic abbey was completed in 1089 but not consecrated until [[Holy Innocents' Day]], 1115, (28 Dec) by the [[Archbishop of Rouen]]. King [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] attended as did many bishops and nobles.

A [[nunnery]] ([[Sopwell Priory]]) was founded nearby in 1140.

Internally the Abbey was bare of sculpture, almost stark. The plaster walls were coloured and patterned in parts, with extensive tapestries adding colour. Sculptural decoration was added, mainly ornaments, as it became more fashionable in the 12th century — especially after the Gothic style arrived in England around 1170.

In the current structure the original Norman arches survive principally under the central tower and on the north side of the nave. The arches in the rest of the building are [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]], following medieval rebuilding and extensions, and [[Victorian era]] restoration.

The Abbey was extended in the 1190s by Abbot [[John de Cella]] (also known as [[John of Wallingford (d. 1214)|John of Wallingford]]) (1195–1214); as the number of monks grew from fifty to over a hundred, the Abbey church was extended westwards with three bays added to the nave. The severe Norman west front was also rebuilt by Hugh de Goldclif — although how is uncertain; it was very costly but its 'rapid' weathering and later alterations have erased all but fragments. A more prominent shrine and altar to Saint Amphibalus were also added.&lt;ref name=tma/&gt; The work was very slow under de Cella and was not completed until the time of Abbot William de Trumpington (1214–35). The low Norman tower roof was demolished and a new, much higher, broached spire was raised, sheathed in lead.

The [[St. Albans Psalter|St Albans Psalter]] (ca. 1130–45) is the best known of a number of important [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] [[illuminated manuscript]]s produced in the Abbey [[scriptorium]].  Later, [[Matthew Paris]], a monk at St Albans from 1217 until his death in 1259, was important both as a [[chronicle]]r and an artist.  Eighteen of his manuscripts survive and are a rich source of contemporary information for historians.

[[Pope Adrian IV|Nicholas Breakspear]] was born near St Albans and applied to be admitted to the Abbey as a novice, but he was turned down. He eventually managed to be accepted into an abbey in France. In 1154 he was elected Pope Adrian IV, the only English [[Pope]] there has ever been. The head of the Abbey was confirmed as the premier abbot in England also in 1154.

The Abbey had a number of daughter houses from [[Tynemouth Castle and Priory|Tynemouth Priory]]&lt;ref name=&quot;northtyneside1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.northtyneside.gov.uk/browse-display.shtml?p_ID=532487&amp;p_subjectCategory=1432 |title=Priors, Kings and Soldiers - North Tyneside Council |publisher=Northtyneside.gov.uk |date=1999-07-01 |accessdate=2017-01-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160106040544/http://www.northtyneside.gov.uk/browse-display.shtml?p_ID=532487&amp;p_subjectCategory=1432 |archive-date=6 January 2016 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the north to [[Binham Priory]] near the Norfolk coast.&lt;ref&gt;Mee, Arthur Mee.

An earthquake shook the Abbey in 1250 and damaged the eastern end of the church. In 1257 the dangerously cracked sections were knocked down — three apses and two bays. The thick [[Presbytery (architecture)|Presbytery]] wall supporting the tower was left. The rebuilding and updating was completed during the rule of Abbot Roger de Norton (1263–90).

On 10 October 1323 two piers on the south side of the nave collapsed dragging down much of the roof and wrecking five bays. Mason Henry Wy undertook the rebuilding, matching the Early English style of the rest of the bays but adding distinctly 14th-century detailing and ornaments. The shrine to St Amphibalus had also been damaged and it was remade.

[[Richard of Wallingford]], abbot from 1297 to 1336 and a mathematician and astronomer, designed a celebrated clock, which was completed by William of Walsham after his death, but apparently destroyed during the reformation.

A new gateway, now called the [[Abbey Gateway, St. Albans|Abbey Gateway]], was built to the Abbey grounds in 1365, which was the only part of the monastery buildings (besides the church) to survive the dissolution, later being used as a prison and now (since 1871) part of [[St Albans School (Hertfordshire)|St Albans School]]. The other monastic buildings were located to the south of the gateway and church.

In the 15th century a large west window of nine main lights and a deep traced head was commissioned by [[John Whethamstede|John of Wheathampstead]]. The spire was reduced to a 'Hertfordshire spike', the roof pitch greatly reduced and battlements liberally added. Further new windows, at £50 each, were put in the transepts by Abbot Wallingford (also known as [[William of Wallingford]]), who also had a new high altar screen made.

===Dissolution and after===
After the death of Abbot Ramryge in 1521 the Abbey fell into debt and slow decay under three weak abbots. At the time of the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] and its surrender on 5 December 1539 the income was £2,100 annually. The abbot and remaining forty monks were pensioned off and then the buildings were looted. All gold, silver and gilt objects were carted away with all other valuables; stonework was broken and defaced and graves opened to burn the contents.

The Abbey became part of the [[diocese of Lincoln]] in 1542 and was moved to the [[diocese of London]] in 1550. The buildings suffered — neglect, second-rate repairs, even active damage. [[Richard Lee (engineer)|Richard Lee]] purchased all the buildings, except the church and chapel and some other Crown premises, in 1550. Lee then began the systematic demolition for building material to improve Lee Hall at [[Sopwell Priory|Sopwell]]. In 1551, with the stone removed, Lee returned the land to the abbot. The area was named Abbey Ruins for the next 200 years or so.

In 1553 the [[Lady chapel]] was used as a school, the Great Gatehouse as a town jail, some other buildings passed to the Crown, and the Abbey Church was sold to the town for [[Pound Sterling|£]]400 in 1553 by [[Edward VI of England|King Edward VI]] to be the church of the parish.

The cost of upkeep fell upon the town, although in 1596 and at irregular intervals later the Archdeacon was allowed to collect money for repairs by Brief in the diocese. After [[James I of England|James I]] visited in 1612 he authorised another Brief, which collected around £2,000 — most of which went on roof repairs. The [[English Civil War]] slashed the monies spent on repairs, while the Abbey Church was used to hold prisoners of war and suffered from their vandalism, as well as that of their guards. Most of the metal objects that had survived the Dissolution were also removed and other ornamental parts were damaged in Puritan sternness. Another round of fund-raising in 1681–84 was again spent on the roof, repairing the Presbytery vault. A royal grant from [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] in 1689 went on general maintenance, 'repairs' to conceal some of the then considered unfashionable Gothic features, and on new internal fittings. There was a second royal grant from William in 1698.

By the end of the 17th century the dilapidation was sufficient for a number of writers to comment upon it.

In 1703, from 26 November to 1 December, the [[Great Storm of 1703|Great Storm]] raged across southern England; the Abbey lost the south transept window which was replaced in wood at a cost of £40. The window was clear glass with five lights and three transoms in an early Gothic Revival style by John Hawgood. Other windows, although not damaged in the storm, were a constant drain on the Abbey budget in the 18th century.

A brief written in 1723–24, seeking £5,775, notes a great crack in the south wall, that the north wall was eighteen inches from vertical, and that the roof timbers were decayed to the point of danger. The money raised was spent on the nave roof over ten bays.

Another brief was not issued until 1764. Again the roof was rotting, as was the south transept window, walls were cracked or shattered in part and the south wall had subsided and now leant outwards. Despite a target of £2,500 a mere £600 was raised.

In the 1770s the Abbey came close to demolition; the expense of repairs meant a scheme to destroy the Abbey and erect a smaller church almost succeeded.

A storm in 1797 caused some subsidence, cracking open graves, scattering pavement tiles, flooding the church interior and leaving a few more arches off-vertical.

===19th century===
[[File:St Albans Wallingford Screen 2, Hertfordshire, UK - Diliff.jpg|thumb|right|The Wallingford Screen of c. 1480 — the statues are [[Victorian era|Victorian]] replacements (1884–89) of the originals, destroyed in the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]], when the screen itself was also damaged.&lt;ref&gt;The Cathedral Church of Saint Albans, Thomas Perkins, 205, p.21&lt;/ref&gt; Statues of [[Saint Alban|St Alban]] and [[Amphibalus|St Amphibalus]] stand on either side of the [[altar]].]]
This century was marked with a number of repair schemes. The Abbey received some money from the 1818 &quot;[[Commissioners' church|Million Act]]&quot;, and in 1820, £450 was raised to buy an [[organ (music)|organ]] — a second-hand example made in 1670.

The major efforts to revive the Abbey Church came under four men — [[Lewis Nockalls Cottingham|L. N. Cottingham]], H. J. B. Nicholson (Rector), and, especially, [[George Gilbert Scott]] and [[Edmund Beckett, 1st Baron Grimthorpe]].

In February 1832 a portion of the [[clerestory]] wall fell through the roof of the south aisle, leaving a hole almost thirty feet long. With the need for serious repair work evident, the architect [[Lewis Nockalls Cottingham]] was called in to survey the building. His ''Survey'' was presented in 1832 and was worrying reading: everywhere mortar was in a wretched condition and wooden beams were rotting and twisting. Cottingham recommended new beams throughout the roof and a new steeper pitch, removal of the spire and new timbers in the tower, new paving, ironwork to hold the west transept wall up, a new stone south transept window, new buttresses, a new drainage system for the roof, new ironwork on almost all the windows, and on and on. He estimated a cost of £14,000. A public subscription of £4,000 was raised, of which £1,700 vanished in expenses. With the limited funds the clerestory wall was rebuilt, the nave roof re-leaded, the tower spike removed, some forty blocked windows reopened and glazed, and the south window remade in stone.

Henry Nicholson, rector from 1835 to 1866, was also active in repairing the Abbey Church — as far as he could, and in uncovering lost or neglected Gothic features.

In 1856 repair efforts began again; £4,000 was raised and slow moves started to gain the Abbey the status of cathedral. [[George Gilbert Scott]] was appointed the project architect and oversaw a [[Victorian restoration|number of works]] from 1860 until his death in 1878.

[[File:St Albans Choir 2, Hertfordshire, UK - Diliff.jpg|thumb|left|The choir]]
Scott began by having the medieval floor restored, necessitating the removal of tons of earth, and fixing the north aisle roof.  From 1872 to 1877 the restored floors were re-tiled in matching stone and copies of old tile designs. A further 2,000 tons of earth were shifted in 1863 during work on the foundation and a new drainage system. In 1870 the tower piers were found to be badly weakened with many cracks and cavities. Huge timbers were inserted and the arches filled with brick as an emergency measure. Repair work took until May 1871 and cost over £2,000. The south wall of the nave was now far from straight; Scott reinforced the north wall and put in scaffolding to take the weight of the roof off the wall, then had it jacked straight in under three hours. The wall was then buttressed with five huge new masses and set right. Scott was lauded as &quot;saviour of the Abbey.&quot; From 1870 to 1875 around £20,000 was spent on the Abbey.

In 1845 St Albans was transferred from the [[Diocese of Lincoln]] to the [[Diocese of Rochester]]. Then, in 1875, the Bishopric of St Albans Act was passed and on 30 April 1877 the [[Diocese of St Albans|See of St Albans]] was created, which comprises about 300 churches in the counties of [[Hertfordshire]] and [[Bedfordshire]]. [[Thomas Legh Claughton]], then [[Bishop of Rochester]], elected to take the northern division of his old diocese and on 12 June 1877 was enthroned first [[Bishop of St Albans]], a position he held until 1890. He is buried in the churchyard on the north side of the nave.

George Gilbert Scott was working on the nave roof, vaulting and west bay when he died on 27 March 1878. His plans were partially completed by his son, [[John Oldrid Scott]], but the remaining work fell into the hands of [[Edmund Beckett, 1st Baron Grimthorpe]], whose efforts have attracted much controversy — [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] calling him a &quot;pompous, righteous bully.&quot; However, he donated much of the immense sum of £130,000 the work cost.

Whereas Scott's work had clearly been in sympathy with the existing building, Grimthorpe's plans reflected the Victorian ideal. Indeed, he spent considerable time dismissing and criticising the work of Scott and the efforts of his son.

Grimthorpe first reinstated the original pitch of the roof, although the battlements added for the lower roof were retained. Completed in 1879, the roof was leaded, following on Scott's desires.
[[File:St Albans West End Wickhamstede window.jpg|thumb|1805 engraving of the west front of the Abbey showing the lost Wheathampstead window.]]
His second major project was the most controversial. The west front, with the great Wheathampstead window, was cracked and leaning, and Grimthorpe, never more than an amateur architect, designed the new front himself — attacked as dense, misproportioned and unsympathetic: &quot;His impoverishment as a designer ... [is] evident&quot;; &quot;this man, so practical and ingenious, was utterly devoid of taste ... his great qualities were marred by arrogance ... and a lack of historic sense&quot;. Counter proposals were deliberately substituted by Grimthorpe for poorly drawn versions and Grimthorpe's design was accepted. During building it was considerably reworked in order to fit the actual frontage and is not improved by the poor quality sculpture. Work began in 1880 and was completed in April 1883, having cost £20,000.

[[File:Cathedral in St albans PS099.png|thumb|The Lady Chapel at the east end of the cathedral]]
Grimthorpe was noted for his aversion to the [[Perpendicular Period|Perpendicular]] — to the extent that he would have sections he disliked demolished as &quot;too rotten&quot; rather than remade. In his reconstruction, especially of windows, he commonly mixed architectural styles carelessly (see the south aisle, the south [[choir screen]] and vaulting). He spent £50,000 remaking the nave. Elsewhere he completely rebuilt the south wall cloisters, with new heavy buttresses, and removed the arcading of the east cloisters during rebuilding the south transept walls. In the south transept he completely remade the south face, completed in 1885, including the huge lancet window group — his proudest achievement — and the flanking turrets; a weighty new tiled roof was also made. In the north transept Grimthorpe had the Perpendicular window demolished and his design inserted — a rose window of circles, cusped circles and lozenges arrayed in five rings around the central light, sixty-four lights in total, each circle with a different glazing pattern.

Grimthorpe continued through the Presbytery in his own style, adapting the antechapel for Consistory Courts, and into the Lady Chapel. After a pointed lawsuit with [[Hucks Gibbs, 1st Baron Aldenham|Henry Hucks Gibbs, 1st Baron Aldenham]], over who should direct the restoration, Grimthorpe had the vault remade and reproportioned in stone, made the floor in black and white marble (1893), and had new Victorian arcading and sculpture put below the canopy work. Externally the buttresses were expanded to support the new roof, and the walls were refaced.

As early as 1897, Grimthorpe was having to return to previously renovated sections to make repairs. His use of over-strong cement led to cracking, while his fondness for ironwork in windows led to corrosion and damage to the surrounding stone.

Grimthorpe died in 1905 and was interred in the churchyard. He left a bequest for continuing work on the buildings.

During this century the name ''[[St Albans Abbey railway station|St Albans Abbey]]'' was given to one of the town's two railway stations.

===20th century===
[[John Oldrid Scott]] (died 1913) ([[George Gilbert Scott]]'s son), despite frequent clashes with Grimthorpe, had continued working within the cathedral. Scott was a steadfast supporter of the Gothic revival and designed the tomb of the first bishop; he had a new bishop's throne built (1903), together with commemorative stalls for Festing (a bishop) and two archdeacons, and new choir stalls. He also repositioned and rebuilt the organ (1907). Further work was interrupted by the war.

A number of memorials to the war were added to the cathedral, notably the painting ''The Passing of Eleanor'' by [[Frank O. Salisbury|Frank Salisbury]] (stolen 1973) and the reglazing of the main west window, dedicated in 1925.

Following the Enabling Act of 1919, control of the buildings passed to a Parochial Church Council (replaced by the Cathedral Council in 1968), who appointed the woodwork specialist John Rogers as Architect and Surveyor of the Fabric. He uncovered extensive [[death watch beetle]] damage in the presbytery vault and oversaw the repair (1930–31). He had four tons of rubbish removed from the crossing tower and the main timbers reinforced (1931–32), and invested in the extensive use of insecticide throughout the wood structures. In 1934, the eight bells were overhauled and four new bells added to be used in the celebration of [[George V]]'s silver jubilee.

[[File:St Albans Cathedral Shrine of St Albans, Hertfordshire, UK - Diliff.jpg|thumb|The shrine of St Alban.]]
Cecil Brown was architect and surveyor from 1939 to 1962. At first he merely oversaw the lowering of the bells for the war and established a fire watch, with the pump in the [[slype]]. After the war, in the 1950s, the organ was removed, rebuilt and reinstalled and new pews added. His major work was on the crossing tower. Grimthorpe's cement was found to be damaging the Roman bricks: every brick in the tower was replaced as needed and reset in proper mortar by one man, Walter Barrett. The tower ceiling was renovated as were the nave murals. Brown established the Muniments Room to gather and hold all the church documents.

In 1972, to encourage a closer link between celebrant and congregation in the nave, the massive nine-ton pulpit along with the choir stalls and permanent pews was dismantled and removed. The altar space was enlarged and improved. New 'lighter' wood (limed oak) choir stalls were put in, and chairs replaced the pews. A new wooden pulpit was acquired from a Norfolk church and installed in 1974. External floodlighting was added in 1975.

A major survey in 1974 revealed new leaks, decay and other deterioration, and a ten-year restoration plan was agreed. Again the roofing required much work. The nave and clerestory roofs were repaired in four stages with new leading. The nave project was completed in 1984 at a total cost of £1.75 million. The clerestory windows were repaired with the corroded iron replaced with delta bronze and other Grimthorpe work on the clerestory was replaced. Seventy-two new heads for the corbel table were made. Grimthorpe's west front was cracking, again due to the use originally of too strong a mortar, and was repaired.

A new visitors' centre was proposed in 1970. Planning permission was sought in 1973; there was a public inquiry and approval was granted in 1977. Constructed to the south side of the cathedral, close to the site of the original chapter house of the Abbey, the new 'Chapter House' cost around £1 million and was officially opened on 8 June 1982 by [[Queen Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth]]. The main building material was 500,000 replica Roman bricks.

Other late 20th-century works include the restoration of Alban's shrine, with a new embroidered canopy, and the stained glass designed by Alan Younger for Grimthorpe's north transept rose window,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1463884/Alan-Younger.html Alan Younger] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160301085237/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1463884/Alan-Younger.html |date=1 March 2016 }}: Obituary in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 2004-06-08&lt;/ref&gt; unveiled in 1989 by [[Diana, Princess of Wales]]. In 2015 seven new painted stone statues by [[Rory Young]] were installed in the medieval niches in the nave screen. This was a rare occurrence as the last painted figures placed in a church screen were put there before the Reformation and the English civil war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.wiltsglosstandard.co.uk/news/12969737.cirencester-sculptor-rory-young-completes-five-year-art-project-at-st-albans-cathedral/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=28 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191028172821/https://www.wiltsglosstandard.co.uk/news/12969737.cirencester-sculptor-rory-young-completes-five-year-art-project-at-st-albans-cathedral/ |archive-date=28 October 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern times==
The [[bishop of St Albans]] is [[Alan Smith (bishop)|Alan Smith]], installed in September 2009. Jonathan Smith is [[Archdeacon of St Albans]], installed in October 2008. On 2 July 2004, [[Jeffrey John]] became the ninth [[Dean of St Albans|dean of the cathedral]].

[[Robert Runcie]], later [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], was Bishop of St Albans from 1970 to 1980 and returned to live in the city after his retirement; he is commemorated by a gargoyle on the cathedral as well as being buried in the graveyard. [[Colin Slee]], former dean of [[Southwark Cathedral]], was sub-dean at St Albans under Runcie and the then dean, Peter Moore. The bishop's residence, Abbey Gate House, is in Abbey Mill Lane, St Albans, as is the house of the [[bishop of Hertford]]. [[Eric James (priest)|Eric James]], Chaplain Extraordinary to the Queen, was canon at St Albans for many years.

===Organists===
{{See also|List of musicians at English cathedrals}}
The master of the music and the assistant master of the music share the responsibility of directing the [[St Albans Cathedral Choir]] and the [[St Albans Cathedral Girls' Choir]] respectively.

The earliest known name of an organist at St Albans is Adam from the early 13th century. [[Robert Fayrfax]], the prominent English Renaissance composer, is recorded as being organist from 1498 to 1502, and was buried there following his death some 20 years later. Since 1820 the post of organist and master of the music has been held by a number of well-known musicians, including [[Peter Hurford]], [[Stephen Darlington]] and [[Barry Rose]]. The current master of the music, since 1998, is Andrew Lucas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stalbansbachchoir.org.uk/andrewlucas.htm Andrew Lucas (St Albans Bach Choir)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114032225/http://www.stalbansbachchoir.org.uk/andrewlucas.htm |date=2010-01-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The assistant master of music at the cathedral is sometimes also the master of music at [[St Albans School (Hertfordshire)|St Albans School]] — for example, [[Simon Lindley]] and [[Andrew Parnell]].

Since 1963 the cathedral has been home to the [[St Albans International Organ Festival]], founded by Peter Hurford, and winners of which include Dame [[Gillian Weir]], [[Thomas Trotter]] and [[Naji Hakim]].

=== Bells ===
In total, there are 23 bells housed in the tower. The main ring of 12 bells (with a sharp 2nd) was cast in 2010 by the [[Whitechapel Bell Foundry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.stalbanscathedral.org/worship/cathedral-bells/the-bells/|title=The Bells - The Cathedral and Abbey Church of Saint Alban|website=www.stalbanscathedral.org|access-date=2019-03-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180614173039/https://www.stalbanscathedral.org/worship/cathedral-bells/the-bells/|archive-date=14 June 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; These replaced the previous ring, 8 of which still remain in the tower and are used for the clock chime and [[carillon]]; the carillon plays a different tune every day of the week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.stalbanscathedral.org/downloads/LIST-OF-HYMNS-PLAYED-BY-THE-CARILLON.pdf|title=List of Hymns Played by the Carillon|access-date=5 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190306045218/https://www.stalbanscathedral.org/downloads/LIST-OF-HYMNS-PLAYED-BY-THE-CARILLON.pdf|archive-date=6 March 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th century the cathedral housed a ring of 5 bells, until they were recast and augmented to 6 in 1699. In 1731 the bells were augmented to a ring of 8 by adding two new bells. Finally, in 2010 the 13 new bells were cast, and were rung for the first time at Easter 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.stalbanscathedral.org/worship/cathedral-bells/|title=Cathedral Bells - The Cathedral and Abbey Church of Saint Alban|website=www.stalbanscathedral.org|access-date=2019-03-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180614171610/https://www.stalbanscathedral.org/worship/cathedral-bells/|archive-date=14 June 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest bell in the tower was cast in c.1290 and is still used today as the [[Church bell#Sanctus bells|sanctus bell]].
