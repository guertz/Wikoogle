The '''New York Mets''' are a [[Major League Baseball]] team based in the [[New York City]] [[Borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[Queens]]. They compete in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) as a member club of the [[National League]] (NL) [[National League East|East division]]. They are one of two MLB teams based in New York City, the other being the [[New York Yankees]] of the [[American League]] (AL).

One of baseball's first [[expansion team]]s, the Mets were founded in 1962 to replace New York's departed NL teams, the [[History of the Brooklyn Dodgers|Brooklyn Dodgers]] and the [[History of the New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]]. The team's colors combine the [[Dodger blue|Dodgers' blue]] and the Giants' orange.&lt;ref name=&quot;timeline1&quot; /&gt; For the 1962 and 1963 seasons, the Mets played home games at the [[Polo Grounds]]. From 1964 to 2008, their home ballpark was [[Shea Stadium]]. In 2009, they moved into their current ballpark, [[Citi Field]].&lt;ref name=&quot;timeline1&quot; /&gt;

In their [[1962 New York Mets season|inaugural season]], the Mets posted a record of 40–120, the worst regular season record since MLB went to a 162-game schedule. The team never finished better than second to last until the [[1969 New York Mets season|&quot;Miracle Mets&quot;]] beat the [[Baltimore Orioles]] in the [[1969 World Series]], one of the biggest upsets in World Series history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.si.com/more-sports/photos/2013/06/24/greatest-upsets-sports-history/15| title=Greatest Upsets In Sports History|work=Sports Illustrated| accessdate=October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, they have played in four World Series, including a dramatic run in {{wsy|1973}} that ended in a seven-game loss to the [[Oakland Athletics]], a second championship in {{wsy|1986}} over the [[Boston Red Sox]], a [[Subway Series]] loss against their [[Mets-Yankees rivalry|cross-town rivals]] the [[New York Yankees]] in {{wsy|2000}},&lt;ref&gt;[http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/history/postseason/mlb_ws_recaps.jsp?feature=2000 MLB – 2000World Series]&lt;/ref&gt; and a five-game loss to the [[Kansas City Royals]] in {{wsy|2015}}.

The Mets qualified to play in the [[Major League Baseball postseason|MLB postseason]] in [[1988 New York Mets season|1988]] and [[2006 New York Mets season|2006]], coming within one game of the World Series both years. After near-misses in 2007 and 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/mets/hard-mets-collapse-article-1.319998 |title=It's hard to believe Mets collapse again |editor=Lupica, Mike |date=September 28, 2008 |newspaper=NY Daily News |accessdate=October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the team made the playoffs in [[2015 New York Mets season|2015]] for the first time in nine years, and won their first NL pennant in 15 years. The team again returned to the playoffs in [[2016 New York Mets season|2016]], this time with a wild card berth. This was the team's second back-to-back playoff appearance, the first occurring during the 1999 and 2000 seasons.

At the end of the [[2019 New York Mets season|2019 season]], the team's overall win-loss record was 4448-4808, a .481 win percentage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New York Mets Team History &amp; Encyclopedia|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/NYM/index.shtml|publisher=Baseball Info Solutions|accessdate=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Franchise history==
{{Main|History of the New York Mets}}
[[File:William Shea.jpg|thumb|upright|[[William Shea]] was instrumental in returning [[National League|National League baseball]] to [[New York City]] after five years of absence.]]
After the 1957 season, the [[History of the Brooklyn Dodgers|Brooklyn Dodgers]] and [[History of the New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]] [[relocation of professional sports teams|relocated]] from New York to California to become the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] and [[San Francisco Giants]], leaving the largest city in the United States with no National League franchise and only one major league team, the [[New York Yankees]] of the [[American League]] (AL). With the threat of a New York team joining a new [[Continental League|third league]], the National League [[1962 Major League Baseball expansion|expanded]] by adding the New York Mets following a proposal from [[William Shea]]. In a symbolic reference to New York's earlier National League teams, the new team took as its primary colors the blue of the Dodgers and the orange of the Giants, both of which are colors also featured on the [[Flag of New York City]]. The nickname &quot;Mets&quot; was adopted: it was a natural shorthand to the club's corporate name, &quot;The New York Metropolitan Baseball Club, Inc.&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The New York Metropolitan Baseball Club, Inc.|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=12486682|publisher=Bloomberg LP|accessdate=2017-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; hearkened back to the &quot;[[New York Metropolitans|Metropolitans]]&quot; (a former New York team in the [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]] from 1880 to 1887),&lt;ref name=&quot;timeline1&quot; /&gt; and its brevity was advantageous for newspaper headlines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nickname&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=New National League Team Here Approves Mets as Its Official Nickname|first=Louis|last=Effrat|newspaper=New York Times|date=May 9, 1961|page=48|authorlink=Louis Effrat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Shea stadium.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Shea Stadium]] was the Mets' home field from 1964 to 2008.]]
For the first two years of its existence, the team played its home games at the historic [[Polo Grounds]] in [[Upper Manhattan]]. In 1964, they moved into newly constructed [[Shea Stadium]] in [[Flushing, Queens]], where the Mets played until the 2008 season. In 2009, the club moved into [[Citi Field]], adjacent to the former Shea Stadium site.

During their history, the Mets have won two [[World Series]] titles ([[1969 World Series|1969]] and [[1986 World Series|1986]]), five National League [[National League Championship Series|pennants]] ([[1969 NLCS|1969]], [[1973 NLCS|1973]], [[1986 NLCS|1986]], [[2000 NLCS|2000]], [[2015 NLCS|2015]]) and six [[National League East]] titles (1969, 1973, 1986, 1988, 2006, 2015). The Mets also qualified for the [[Major League Baseball postseason|postseason]] as the National League [[Major League Baseball wild card|wild card]] team in 1999, 2000, and 2016. The Mets have appeared in five World Series, more than any other [[expansion team]] in MLB history. Their two championships are the most titles among expansion teams, equal to the tallies of the [[Toronto Blue Jays]], [[Miami Marlins]], and [[Kansas City Royals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dodd |first=Mike |date=April 11, 2011 |title=MLB expansion effects still felt 50 years later around the leagues |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/2011-04-07-angels-baseball-expansion_N.htm |newspaper=USA Today |location= |access-date=March 6, 2015 |quote=Despite a record 120 losses in their debut season, the New York Mets can make a case as the most successful expansion franchise, with four pennants and two World Series titles. None of the others has more than two league titles, though the Toronto Blue Jays and Florida Marlins each won two world championships in significantly fewer years. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mets held the New York baseball single-season attendance record for 29 years. They broke the [[New York Yankees|Yankees]]' 1948 record by drawing nearly 2.7 million spectators in 1970. The Mets broke their own record five times before the record was regained by the Yankees in 1999.&lt;ref name=BRNYMattend&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/NYM/attend.shtml|title=New York Mets attendance|website=Baseball Reference|accessdate=August 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BRNYYattend&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/NYY/attend.shtml|title=New York Yankees attendance|website=Baseball Reference|accessdate=August 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tom Seaver at Shea Stadium 1974 CROP.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Tom Seaver]] led the Mets to victory in the [[1969 World Series]].]]
The [[1962 New York Mets season|1962 Mets]] posted a 40–120 record, a record for the most losses in a season since 1899. In 1966, the Mets famously bypassed future Hall of Famer [[Reggie Jackson]] in the [[1966 Major League Baseball draft|amateur draft]], instead selecting [[Steve Chilcott]], who never played in the majors. But the following year, they acquired future Hall of Famer [[Tom Seaver]] in a lottery. Seaver helped the [[1969 New York Mets season|1969 &quot;Miracle Mets&quot;]] win the new [[National League East]] division title, then defeat the [[1969 Atlanta Braves season|Atlanta Braves]] to win the National League pennant and the heavily favored [[1969 Baltimore Orioles season|Baltimore Orioles]] to win the [[1969 World Series]].

In [[1973 New York Mets season|1973]], the Mets rallied from 5th place to win the division, despite a record of only 82–79. They shocked the heavily favored [[1973 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati Reds]] &quot;[[The Big Red Machine|Big Red Machine]]&quot; in the [[1973 National League Championship Series|NLCS]] and pushed the defending World Series champion [[1973 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland Athletics]] to a seventh game, but lost the series. Notably, 1973 was the only NL East title between 1970 and 1980 that wasn't won by either the [[Phillies–Pirates rivalry|Philadelphia Phillies or the Pittsburgh Pirates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philadelphia.phillies.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20050707&amp;content_id=1119893&amp;vkey=news_phi&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=phi|title=Notes: Phils–Pirates rivalry fading|date=July 7, 2005|accessdate=January 3, 2011|first=George|last=Von Benko|website=Philadelphia Phillies|publisher=MLB|quote=From 1974–80, the [[Philadelphia Phillies|Phillies]] and [[Pittsburgh Pirates|Pirates]] won all seven National League East titles (Phillies four, Pirates three).|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714103810/http://philadelphia.phillies.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20050707&amp;content_id=1119893&amp;vkey=news_phi&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=phi|archivedate=July 14, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pirates perform rare three-peat feat 4–2|date=September 28, 1992|newspaper=USA Today|page=5C|quote=The Pirates...won three (NL East titles) in a row from 1970–72.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Star pitcher Tom Seaver was traded in [[1977 New York Mets season|1977]], on a day remembered as &quot;the Midnight Massacre&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Madden |first=Bill |title=The true story of The Midnight Masscare |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/mets/true-story-midnight-massacre-article-1.224970 |access-date=September 28, 2014 |newspaper=[[New York Daily News]] |date=June 17, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171009142708/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/mets/midnight-massacre-article-1.224970 |archive-date=October 9, 2017 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Mets fell into last place for several years. The franchise turned around in the mid-1980s. During this time the Mets also drafted slugger [[Darryl Strawberry]] (#1 in 1980) and 1985 [[Cy Young Award]] winner [[Dwight Gooden]] (#5 in 1982). In addition, former National League MVP and perennial [[Gold Glove]] winner [[Keith Hernandez]] was obtained by the Mets in 1983.

In [[1985 New York Mets season|1985]], they acquired Hall of Fame catcher [[Gary Carter]] from the [[Montreal Expos]] and won 98 games, but narrowly missed the playoffs. In [[1986 New York Mets season|1986]], they won the division with a record of 108–54, one of the best in National League history. They won a dramatic [[1986 National League Championship Series|NLCS]] in six games over the [[1986 Houston Astros season|Houston Astros]]. The sixth game of the series went sixteen innings, the longest playoff game in history until 2005. They came within one strike of losing the [[1986 World Series|World Series]] against the [[1986 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]] before a series of hits and defensive miscues ultimately led to an error by Boston's [[Bill Buckner]] which gave the Mets a game 6 victory. They then won Game 7 to win their second World Series title.

[[File:Mike Piazza spring of 2004.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Mike Piazza]] playing for the Mets in 2004.]]
The Mets continued playing well after 1986 and won the division in [[1988 New York Mets season|1988]], but lost [[1988 NLCS|in the NLCS]] that year and declined into the 1990s. They were out of contention until the [[1997 New York Mets season|1997 season]] when they were in [[Major League Baseball wild card|wild card]] contention until the final week of the season. In [[1998 New York Mets season|1998]], the Mets acquired catcher [[Mike Piazza]] in a blockbuster trade and missed the postseason by only one game. In [[1999 New York Mets season|1999]], they made the playoffs after [[1999 National League Wild Card tie-breaker game|a one-game playoff]], but lost the [[1999 National League Championship Series]] to the [[1999 Atlanta Braves season|Atlanta Braves]]. In [[2000 New York Mets season|2000]], they easily clinched a wild card spot in the playoffs, and earned a trip to the [[2000 World Series]] against their crosstown rivals, the New York Yankees for a &quot;[[Subway Series]]&quot;. The Mets were defeated by the Yankees in five games.

The Mets had a near playoff miss in 2001 and struggled from 2002 to 2004. In the aftermath of the 2004 season, the Mets hired a new general manager, [[Omar Minaya]], who immediately turned the franchise around by signing pitcher [[Pedro Martínez]] and hiring a new manager, [[Willie Randolph]]. The Mets finished 2005 four games over .500, and the franchise's resurgence was complete by 2006 as they won 97 games and the NL East title behind new acquisitions [[Carlos Beltrán]] and [[Carlos Delgado]], as well as young superstars [[José Reyes (shortstop)|José Reyes]] and [[David Wright]]. The Mets advanced to game seven of the [[2006 NLCS]] but lost after [[Yadier Molina]]'s game-winning two-run home run in the top of the ninth inning. The Mets loaded the bases with two outs in the bottom of the inning, but [[Adam Wainwright]] struck out Beltran looking with a devastating [[curveball]].

In 2007, the Mets entered the final 17 games in the season with a seven-game lead in the division. But the team went on an ill-timed losing streak, losing 11 of the next 15 games and needing to win their final two games to make the playoffs. The Mets won their penultimate game, but on the final day of the season, [[Tom Glavine]] gave up seven runs in the first inning en route to an 8–1 loss that eliminated the team from contention. The Philadelphia Phillies won the division by one game after a win on the season's last day.

[[File:David Wright warmup 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[David Wright]] was the most recent Mets captain before retiring in 2018.]]
The Mets held a more modest 3.5-game lead after 145 games of the [[2008 New York Mets season|2008 season]], their final season at [[Shea Stadium]]. While their 7–10 mark down the stretch was better than the previous season's 5–12, it still allowed the Phillies to pass them once again for the division crown, which they lost by three games. The Mets opened [[Citi Field]] in 2009, but were not a factor due to a rash of injuries to numerous key players including Reyes, [[Carlos Beltrán]], [[Carlos Delgado]], [[Óliver Pérez]] and [[Liván Hernández]]. The effect of the injuries plummeted the Mets to a 70–92 record. The Mets improved to a 79–83 in 2010, but still finished in fourth place, missing the playoffs for the fourth straight year.

After the 2010 season, the Mets fired Minaya and manager [[Jerry Manuel]]. Former [[Oakland Athletics]] G.M. and MLB executive [[Sandy Alderson]] was hired to run the team, who hired [[Terry Collins]] as manager.

In 2012, Mets owners [[Fred Wilpon]] and [[Saul Katz]] settled a lawsuit brought against them on behalf of the victims of [[Bernard Madoff]]'s [[Ponzi scheme]] for $162 million. As a result of this agreement the liquidator, [[Irving Picard]], agreed to drop the charges that Wilpon and Katz blindly went along with the scheme for their personal benefit. Picard had originally sought to recover $1 billion from the Wilpon family and Katz, but settled for $162 million along with the admission that neither the Wilpons nor Katz had any knowledge of the Ponzi scheme. In 2011–2012, Mets ownership sold twelve minority 4% shares (48%) of the franchise at $20 million apiece to provide a cash infusion of $240 million for the team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/new-york/mlb/story/_/id/7708498/new-york-mets-settle-madoff-trustee-162-million|title=New York Mets settle with Madoff trustee for $162 million – ESPN New York|work=ESPN.com|accessdate=October 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite yet another losing season, the Mets made history in 2011 when closer [[Jason Isringhausen]] converted his [[300 save club|300th save]] with the team, the third player in franchise history to reach the milestone while with the organization (after [[John Franco]] and [[Billy Wagner]]). Also, Reyes became the first Met in franchise history to win a [[List of Major League Baseball batting champions|National League batting title]], posting a .337 [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]]. In 2012, as the Mets tried to bounce back from three consecutive losing seasons, they lost star shortstop Reyes to free agency, when he signed with the [[Miami Marlins]]. The team started out strong, getting a career-year performance from the league's only knuckleballer, [[R.A. Dickey]], and strong production from Wright. But they faltered midseason and ended with a 74–88 record, again finishing fourth in the division.

[[File:Johan Santana on May 5, 2012.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Johan Santana]] threw the only [[no-hitter]] in Mets history in 2012.]]
Prior to the [[2012 New York Mets season|2012 season]] the Mets had yet to throw a [[no-hitter]], and the franchise's hurlers had gone 8,019&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/new-york/mlb/story/_/id/7999246/new-york-mets-johan-santana-tosses-first-no-hitter-franchise-history|title=Johan Santana tosses no-hitter|work=ESPN.com|accessdate=October 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; games without pitching one – longer than any other major-league franchise. They were one of only two major-league teams to never have a pitcher throw a no-hitter (the other being the [[San Diego Padres]]). However, on June 1, 2012 [[Johan Santana]] pitched a no-hitter against the [[St. Louis Cardinals]]. Averting the spotlight from [[Carlos Beltrán]]'s return to Citi Field, Santana turned a routine game into a memorable moment in Mets history. Santana risked being removed from the game after he went over his limit of 110 pitches, placed by the team because of his shoulder surgery. Still Santana stayed in the game and threw 134 total pitches that evening in an 8–0 Mets victory, helped by a few great defensive plays as well as a controversial foul-ball call (coincidentally on Beltran), to pull off the first no-hitter in Mets history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Santana pitches first no-hitter in Mets' history|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-400_162-57445977/santana-pitches-first-no-hitter-in-mets-history|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=June 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; That was the high point of 2012 along with pitcher [[R.A. Dickey]] winning the National League Cy Young Award. This would be Dickey's final season with the Mets, though, as he along with [[Josh Thole]] and [[Mike Nickeas]] were traded to the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] for prospects [[Travis d'Arnaud]], [[Noah Syndergaard]], Wuilmer Becerra, and veteran catcher [[John Buck (baseball)|John Buck]]. The [[2013 New York Mets season|2013 season]] brought another 74–88 finish but they were able to finish in 3rd place. The highlight of the season was sweeping the season series between their cross town rivals Yankees, a first since interleague play started in 1997.

[[File:Jacob deGrom.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jacob deGrom]], the 2014 [[Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year]] and 2018 and 2019 Cy Young Award Winner.]]
Prior to the start of the [[2014 New York Mets season|2014 season]] the Mets made a big splash in the free agent market by signing former [[New York Yankees]] outfielder [[Curtis Granderson]] to a 4-year $60 million contract. They also signed former [[Oakland Athletics]] starting pitcher [[Bartolo Colón]] to a 2-year deal to help offset losing ace pitcher [[Matt Harvey]] for the year after he required [[Tommy John surgery]]. They would improve to 79–83 and finish the season tied for 2nd place with Atlanta but it was their 6th consecutive season where they finished under .500. Pitcher [[Jacob deGrom]] would win the [[National League Rookie of the Year]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/new-york/mlb/story/_/id/11855105/2014-mlb-rookie-year-jacob-degrom-new-york-mets-named-nl-winner|title=2014 MLB Rookie of the Year – Jacob deGrom of New York Mets named NL winner|website=ESPN.com|date=November 11, 2014|access-date=August 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 23, 2015 the Mets tied a franchise season record of eleven straight wins. For the first time in its history the Mets won ten straight homestand games, becoming the 7th team since 1900 to win at least 10 straight homestand games.&lt;ref&gt;Pelzman, JP.

They defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers in the [[2015 NLDS|NLDS]], three games to two, and swept the Chicago Cubs in the [[2015 NLCS|NLCS]] for their first pennant in 15 years. In the [[2015 World Series]], they were defeated by the [[Kansas City Royals]] in five games. After the season ended, pitcher [[Matt Harvey]] won the [[Major League Baseball Comeback Player of the Year Award|NL Comeback Player of the Year]] award. Outfielder [[Yoenis Céspedes]] won the [[Rawlings Gold Glove Award|NL Gold Glove]] award as a left fielder.

==Theme song==
&quot;[[Meet the Mets]]&quot; is the Mets' signature song, written in 1961, one year before the first season, by Bill Katz and [[Ruth Roberts]]. It is played on the radio, during television broadcasts and at Mets' home games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ruth Roberts, 'Meet the Mets' Songwriter, Dies at 84|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/05/arts/music/ruth-roberts-meet-the-mets-songwriter-dies-at-84.html?_r=1|work=The New York Times|author=Keepnews, Peter|date=July 4, 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/600TcwGbx?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/05/arts/music/ruth-roberts-meet-the-mets-songwriter-dies-at-84.html?_r=1&amp;amp&amp;amp&amp;amp&amp;gt;+Sports)&amp;amp;seid=auto&amp;amp;smid=tw-nytimessports|archivedate=July 7, 2011|accessdate=July 7, 2011|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

==Mascot==
{{For|more information|Mr. Met}}
[[Mr. Met]] is the official mascot of the New York Mets. He was introduced on the cover of game programs in 1963, when the Mets were still playing at the [[Polo Grounds]] in northern Manhattan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mr. Met&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=He's In The Army Now: The Life And Times Of Mr. Met|url=http://www.queenstribune.com/archives/featurearchive/feature2002/0425/feature_story.html|newspaper=Queens Tribune|author1=McGuire, Stephen |author2=Liz Goff |date=April 25, 2002|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615113257/http://www.queenstribune.com/archives/featurearchive/feature2002/0425/feature_story.html|archivedate=June 15, 2011|url-status=dead|accessdate=October 4, 2009|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

The Mets have had two mascots other than Mr. and Mrs. Met at different points in its history. The franchise's original official mascot was Homer, a [[beagle]] trained by [[Rudd Weatherwax]] that lived at the [[Waldorf Astoria New York|Waldorf-Astoria]], was sponsored by [[Rheingold Beer]] and had his own platform behind home plate at the [[Polo Grounds]]. The dog was not included in the ballclub's transition to [[Shea Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.si.com/vault/1992/05/25/126550/bad-beyond-belief-thirty-years-ago-the-newborn-new-york-mets-made-baseball-history-of-the-most-dubious-kind Rushin, Steve. &quot;Bad Beyond Belief,&quot; ''Sports Illustrated'', May 25, 1992.] Retrieved September 4, 2019&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Zd7a93T6FTMC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;lpg=PA26&amp;dq=new+york+mets+mascot+homer+beagle&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4Qk4VZaIcj&amp;sig=ACfU3U3qZCrCfKRT5I_0PvlwgbB3H0x8vw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjstZ6z5LfkAhVKEawKHYjkBJg4ChDoATAEegQICBAB#v=onepage&amp;q=new%20york%20mets%20mascot%20homer%20beagle&amp;f=false Silverman, Matthew.

==Uniform and logo symbolism==
[[Image:Jerry Koosman 2008-09-28.jpg|thumb|right|143px|[[Jerry Koosman]] wearing his late-1960s' era Mets jersey, which served as an inspiration for the 2012–13 Mets pinstriped uniform.]]
{{For|more information|Logos and uniforms of the New York Mets}}
The Mets' colors are blue and orange, originally chosen to honor the city's history of [[National League]] baseball; blue for the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]], and orange for the [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]]. Blue and orange are also the colors of New York City, as seen on its [[Flag of New York City|flag]].&lt;ref name=&quot;timeline1&quot; /&gt;

In 1998, black was officially added to the color scheme, although beginning with 2012 the black elements in the uniform began to be phased out, and were completely eliminated in 2013.

===Logo===
The primary logo, designed by sports cartoonist Ray Gotto, consists of &quot;Mets&quot; written in orange script trimmed in white across a blue representation of the New York City skyline with a white suspension bridge in the foreground, all contained in an orange circle with orange baseball stitching across the image. Each part of the skyline has special meaning—at the left is a church spire, symbolic of Brooklyn, the borough of churches; the second building from the left is the [[Williamsburgh Savings Bank Building]], the tallest building in Brooklyn at the time of the team's founding; next is the [[Woolworth Building]]; after a general skyline view of midtown comes the [[Empire State Building]]; at the far right is the [[headquarters of the United Nations]]. The suspension bridge in the center symbolizes that the Mets, by bringing National League baseball back to New York, represent all five boroughs; many of New York's major bridges are suspension designs.&lt;ref name=&quot;timeline1&quot; /&gt; In 1999, the logo received a slight alteration; a small &quot;NY&quot; originally placed to the left of the team script was removed. No other notable changes have ever been made to the logo.

The cap logo consists of an interlocking &quot;NY&quot; identical to the logo used by the New York Giants in their final years, and is on a blue cap reminiscent of the caps worn by the Brooklyn Dodgers.

With the introduction of black as an official color, an alternate team logo was created in 1999. It is identical to the original logo, but the skyline is black instead of blue and the &quot;Mets&quot; script is blue trimmed in orange and white instead of orange trimmed in white (the alternate black jerseys displayed the primary blue and orange logo on the left sleeves in 1998; in 1999 this was changed to the alternate black and blue logo). The logo fell into disuse after the Mets dropped the alternate black jerseys and caps in 2012.

===Uniform color and design===
Currently, the Mets wear an assortment of uniforms.

The home uniforms are white with blue pinstripes, and feature the &quot;Mets&quot; script and block lettering and numbers in blue with orange outline. The uniforms are paired with a standard blue cap featuring the &quot;NY&quot; script in orange, plus blue undersleeves, belts and socks. The white pinstriped uniforms replaced both the cream pinstriped uniform and the alternate white uniform starting with the 2015 season.

The gray road jerseys feature a radially-arched &quot;NEW YORK&quot; script in Tiffany style, player numerals and names in blue outlined in orange, and blue placket and sleeve piping. Like the home uniforms, the road grays are worn with blue caps, undersleeves, belts and socks.

On November 14, 2012, the Mets introduced two new blue alternate jerseys. The home alternate features the &quot;Mets&quot; script, player numerals and names in orange outlined in white, while the road alternate feature the &quot;NEW YORK&quot; script, player numerals and names in gray outlined in orange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sportslogos.net/2012/11/14/ny-mets-show-off-new-blue-alternate-jersey/ |title=NY Mets Show Off Two New Blue Alternate Jerseys &amp;#124; Chris Creamer's SportsLogos.Net News and Blog : New Logos and New Uniforms news, photos, and rumours |publisher=News.sportslogos.net |date= |accessdate=January 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 10, 2012, the Mets unveiled an alternate blue fielding cap, featuring an orange brim and a white trim around the orange &quot;NY&quot; insignia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sportslogos.net/2012/12/10/new-york-mets-use-press-conferences-to-unveil-new-alternate-hat/ |title=New York Mets Unveil New Alt Cap at Press Conference &amp;#124; Chris Creamer's SportsLogos.Net News and Blog : New Logos and New Uniforms news, photos, and rumours |publisher=News.sportslogos.net |date= |accessdate=January 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently it is only worn in games featuring the home blue alternates. For 2015, another alternate blue cap, this time featuring the &quot;NY&quot; in gray outlined in orange, was introduced, and is paired with the road blue alternates. In 2017, the alternate home blue cap was modified to feature a blue brim.

For the 2014 season, a [[Mr. Met]] sleeve patch was added to the blue alternate jerseys,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Chris Creamer |url=http://news.sportslogos.net/2013/12/20/mr-met-added-to-new-york-mets-2014-uniforms/ |title=Mr. Met added to New York Mets 2014 Uniforms|publisher=News.sportslogos.net |date=December 20, 2013 |accessdate=April 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a feature that was later removed in favor of the primary logo in 2017.

The Mets' standard blue batting helmet, with the &quot;NY&quot; in orange, is currently used regardless of the cap and jersey design they wear. This was in contrast to previous seasons, where they played with alternate batting helmets to match their caps and jerseys.

Major League Baseball retired [[Jackie Robinson]]'s number 42 on April 15, 1997, when the Mets played the [[1997 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Dodgers]] at [[Shea Stadium]]. [[Butch Huskey]] wore the number throughout the rest of his Mets career because of a [[grandfather clause]] placed on the retired number by MLB.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson #&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=A Grand Tribute to Robinson and His Moment|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/16/sports/a-grand-tribute-to-robinson-and-his-moment.html|work=The New York Times|author=Smith, Claire|date=April 16, 1997|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111203093116/http://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/16/sports/a-grand-tribute-to-robinson-and-his-moment.html|archivedate=December 3, 2011|url-status=live|accessdate=June 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mo Vaughn]] also wore 42 during his stint with the Mets, because of the same clause.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson #&quot;/&gt;

On the final opening day at Shea Stadium, April 8, 2008, the Mets unveiled a sign bearing the name [[William Shea|&quot;Shea&quot;]] next to the team's retired numbers honoring William Shea and his contributions to the franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Shea family to be honored at home|url=http://newyork.mets.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080403&amp;content_id=2488641|publisher=New York Mets|author=DiComo, Anthony|date=April 3, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009050416/http://newyork.mets.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080403&amp;content_id=2488641|archivedate=October 9, 2012|accessdate=June 4, 2011|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, a special memorial logo honoring broadcaster [[Ralph Kiner]], depicting a microphone along with his name and the years 1922–2014, was displayed on the left field wall adjacent to, but not as a part of, the Mets' retired numbers, from 2014 to 2016. In the 2016 Mets yearbook, a sidebar in an article on Mike Piazza's upcoming number retirement implies that Kiner has been &quot;retired&quot; a la William A. Shea.&lt;ref&gt;2016 New York Mets Yearbook, page 62,&lt;/ref&gt;  This was confirmed when the Mets' retired numbers were moved to the roof facade during the 2016 season to accommodate Mike Piazza's #31; the Kiner logo was placed next to the Shea and Jackie Robinson numbers, no longer separated from the others.

On September 24, 2019 the New York Mets announced that they will retire [[Jerry Koosman]]'s #36 during the 2020 season, making him only the 3rd former Mets player to have their number retired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet |user=AnthonyDiComo |number=1176587811304202240 |date=24 September 2019 |title=Some news: The Mets are going to retire Jerry Koosman's uniform number 36 next year.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Desi Relaford]] was the last Mets player to wear No. 8; [[Matt Galante]], a coach, later wore the number. After Carter's death, the Mets honored him in a ceremony on opening day 2012, where they unveiled the &quot;Kid 8&quot; memorial logo (also worn on the uniform sleeve) on the outfield fence.

==Rivalries==

===Subway Series: New York Yankees===
{{main|Mets–Yankees rivalry|Subway Series}}

The Mets&amp;nbsp;– New York Yankees rivalry is the latest incarnation of the [[Subway Series]], the competition between New York City's teams, the [[American League]] [[New York Yankees]] and the [[National League]] Mets. Until [[Interleague play]] started, the two teams had only met in exhibition games. Since the inception of interleague play the two teams have met every regular season since 1997, and since 1999 they have met six times each season, playing two three-game series, one in each team's ballpark. From the 2013 season however the number of games was reduced to four, two at each ballpark with the Mets winning six of the last eight games in that span. They have made the postseason in the same year four times: 1999, 2000, 2006, and 2015, and faced off in the [[2000 World Series]].

The Braves–Mets [[Major League Baseball rivalries|rivalry]] is a rivalry between two teams in the [[National League East]], featuring the [[Atlanta Braves]] and the Mets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Lisa |last=Olson |author-link=Lisa Olson |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/sports/2003/07/08/2003-07-08_crazy_scene_at_shea_takes_lu.html?print=1&amp;viewall=1 |title=Crazy scene at Shea takes luster off Mets-Braves rivalry |newspaper=[[New York Daily News]] |date=July 8, 2003 |access-date=23 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180613234758/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/sports/crazy-scene-shea-takes-luster-mets-braves-rivalry-article-1.528122 |archive-date=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although their first major confrontation occurred when the Mets swept the Braves in the [[1969 National League Championship Series|1969 NLCS]], en route to their first [[World Series]] championship, the first playoff series won by an expansion team (also the first playoff appearance by an expansion team), the rivalry did not become especially heated until the 1990s, when division realignment put the Mets and the Braves in the same division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|quote=The Pirates will switch from the East next season. They opposed the move last week when realignment was approved, but agreed to allow Atlanta to move to the East.|title=Pirates OK new realignment|date=September 16, 1993|first=Hal|last=Bodley|newspaper=USA Today|page=1C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pirates Relent on New Alignment|date=September 16, 1993|first=Murray|last=Chass|newspaper=New York Times|page=B14|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/16/sports/baseball-pirates-relent-on-new-alignment.html?pagewanted=print|authorlink=Murray Chass}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The two teams faced each other again in the [[1999 National League Championship Series|1999 NLCS]], and the [[1999 Atlanta Braves season|Braves]] won the series four games to two. However, they would go on to lose to the [[1999 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] in the [[1999 World Series]].

===Philadelphia Phillies===
{{main|Mets–Phillies rivalry}}

The rivalry between the Mets and the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] from 2006 to 2008 was said to be among the &quot;hottest&quot; rivalries in the [[National League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/mets/2008/04/11/2008-04-11_metsphillies_rivalry_looking_like_what_m-2.html |title=Mets-Phillies rivalry looking like what Mets-Braves used to be |last=Bondy |first=Filip |date=April 11, 2008 |newspaper=[[New York Daily News]] |access-date=June 15, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180322214658/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/mets/mets-phillies-rivalry-mets-braves-article-1.281288 |archive-date=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=K_e8KWxmo_kC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=Mets-Phillies+rivalry#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Philadelphia Phillies Past &amp; Present|page=10|first=Rich|last=Westcott|publisher=MVP Books|year=2010|accessdate=July 15, 2011|isbn=9780760337844}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from several brawls in the 1980s, the rivalry remained low-key before the 2006 season,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/sports/2006/05/24/2006-05-24_despite_long_game__rivalry_l.html |title=Despite long game, rivalry long way off |last=Bondy |first=Filip |date=May 24, 2006 |newspaper=[[New York Daily News]] |access-date=January 11, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180723153746/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/sports/long-game-rivalry-long-article-1.556296 |archive-date=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the teams had seldom been equally good at the same time. Since 2006, the teams have battled for playoff position. The Mets won the division in 2006 and contended in 2007 and 2008, while the Phillies won five consecutive division titles from 2007 to 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philadelphia.phillies.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2011_09_17_slnmlb_phimlb_1&amp;mode=recap&amp;c_id=phi|title=High Phive: Phils clinch fifth straight East title|date=September 17, 2011|accessdate=September 18, 2011|first=Mike|last=Radano|website=Philadelphia Phillies|publisher=MLB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Phillies' 2007 Eastern Division Title was won on the last day of the season as the Mets lost a seven-game lead with 17 games remaining while losing 12 of 18 games that season to the Phillies, including being swept at home in the first 3 games of the remaining 17, dropping their lead from 7 games to 3.5.

===Television===
Most Mets games are carried by [[SportsNet New York]] (SNY), a joint venture of the Mets and [[NBC Sports Regional Networks]]. The team's terrestrial broadcast home is [[WPIX]], where the team has broadcast games since 1999.

Longtime Mets radio announcer [[Gary Cohen]] does the play-by-play, having moved to television with the launch of SNY in 2006. Former Mets [[Keith Hernandez]] and [[Ron Darling]] are the color commentators with [[Steve Gelbs]] being the on the field reporter.

In early January 2016, Keith Hernandez re-signed with SNY. Reports indicate that Hernandez received a raise and three-year contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Keith Hernandez to return to SNY|url = https://www.sny.tv/mets/news/keith-hernandez-to-return-to-sny/161798482|website = SNY|access-date = February 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radio===
Beginning in 2019, Mets games are broadcast on [[WCBS (AM)|WCBS-AM 880]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=WCBS 880 To Be Mets' New Flagship Radio Home |url=https://wfan.radio.com/articles/news/wcbs-880-be-mets-new-flagship-radio-home |work= |publisher=WFAN Sports Radio |author=Entercom Communications |date=September 17, 2018  |accessdate=January 2, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Howie Rose]] is the main play-by-play announcer; [[Josh Lewin]], his broadcast partner since 2012, will not return.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Wayne Randazzo Likely Headed to Mets' Radio Booth |url=https://sportsradiopd.com/wayne-randazzo-likely-headed-to-mets-radio-booth/ |work= |publisher=BSM Sports Media |author= |date=December 4, 2018  |accessdate=January 1, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wayne Randazzo, who previously hosted the pre- and post-game shows, will replace Lewin; longtime Mets beat reporter [[Ed Coleman (radio personality)|Ed Coleman]] will take over the pre- and post-game role for most games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=The new Mets booth will start on a short leash |url=https://nypost.com/2019/01/02/the-new-mets-booth-will-start-on-a-short-leash|work= |publisher=New York Post |author=Marchand, Andrew |date=January 2, 2019  |accessdate=January 2, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mets' previous radio flagship was [[WOR (AM)|WOR-AM]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wor710.com/articles/local-news-465659/the-mets-find-new-home-at-11791827/ The Mets Find New Home at WOR&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; from 2014-2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=New York Mets Move Radio Broadcasts To WCBS/Entercom |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/setheverett/2018/09/18/new-york-mets-move-radio-broadcasts-to-wcbs-entercom/#52e0556343c8/ |work= |publisher=Forbes |author=Everett, Seth |date=September 18, 2018  |accessdate=January 1, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Mets were previously carried by [[WFAN (AM)|WFAN-AM]], which inherited the team's broadcast rights from [[WEPN (AM)#WHN|WHN]] when it took over its frequency in 1987, and in later years by [[WFAN-FM]] which simulcasts the AM signal.

Spanish-language broadcasts are carried by [[WEPN (AM)|WEPN-AM 1050]], ESPN Deportes Nueva York, featuring Juan Alicea and Max Perez-Jimenez.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Mets Radio &amp; TV Coverage |url=https://www.mlb.com/mets/team/broadcast-information |work= |publisher=New York Mets |author= |date=  |accessdate=January 2, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rose, who has spent much of his career covering the Mets, replaced [[Bob Murphy (broadcaster)|Bob Murphy]] as Gary Cohen's broadcast partner in 2004 following Murphy's retirement. Cohen then left the radio booth for the [[SportsNet New York|SNY]] television booth in 2006 and was replaced by [[Tom McCarthy (broadcaster)|Tom McCarthy]], who departed after two seasons and was replaced by [[Wayne Hagin]]. Lewin joined the broadcast after the team parted ways with Hagin following the 2011 season.

Coinciding with the move to WCBS, the Mets, abruptly and without public announcement (other than a brief e-mail to its affiliates days before the season began), stopped syndicating its games to other stations outside the New York City area, shutting down the [[New York Mets Radio Network]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.timesunion.com/sports/article/Mets-abandon-upstate-radio-network-for-2019-season-13727103.php Mets abandon upstate radio network for 2019 season] from the ''Times-Union'' of Albany, NY; April 1, 2019&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.syracuse.com/mets/2019/04/new-york-mets-radio-blackout-a-middle-finger-to-cny-fans-ceo-says.html New York Mets radio blackout a ‘middle finger’ to CNY fans, CEO says], from The Post-Standard of Syracuse, NY (April 1, 2019)&lt;/ref&gt;
